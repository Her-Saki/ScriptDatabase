It's been three days since Ohta's incident.@>
Out of the blue, she lost her mind and began to scratch her own face until turning it into a bloody pulp.#

{BLOCK:1}
According to her family and friends' testimonies, she behaved completely normal before that day.@>
However, she went crazy specifically in the day of the accident.#

{BLOCK:2}
"Y'know?@ The other day I tried to talk with her like usual, and Kanako turned her face slowly with this creeeeepy smile.@>
I kid you not, that was DISGUSTING!@ It was exactly like the face of a ghost I saw in a TV show the other day.@ Maybe by then she had already gone bonkers, who knows?"#

{BLOCK:3}
Naturally, Ohta became the trending topic of every classroom for the next two days after the incident.@>
They say she was hospitalized in a general hospital in order to operate her, and that she'll be transferred to a psychiatric ward next week.@>
People's also spreading careless rumors about the source of her insanity.@>
That she was always neurotic, that she did drugs...@>
There's even a theory according to which her boyfriend cheated on her and she was left so traumatized that wanted someone to rape her.#

{BLOCK:4}
However, as anybody would expect, three days later people got tired of that topic and established a sort of weird "pact of silence", so Ohta's incident became a taboo issue.#

{BLOCK:5}
Until yesterday's afternoon everyone was talking excitedly about Ohta, but as soon as someone suggested making a pact of silence, they immediately turned tails.@>
I think every single of them are coward sheeps.@ They act according to other people's reactions, and instead of holding their own opinion, they follow blindly whatever trash the mass believes.@ They're really stupid.#

{BLOCK:6}
That's why, despite she lost her mind, I can't help but relate to Ohta.#
