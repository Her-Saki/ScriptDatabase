"What can I help you with?"@>
I break the ice first.@ Honestly, I think the tone of my speech is not very "familiar".@ Perhaps I should have said "What's the matter?" instead.\c

{BLOCK:1}
My uncle takes out a cigarette from his pocket without haste, and lights it with a 100 yen lighter as he covers it from the wind with his hands.@ He inhales the smoke as if taking a deep breath, and takes his time to exhale.@>
"Lately the office banned smoking indoors.@ It's hella maddening."@>
Before this unimportant topic he brings up, I merely answer "I see".#

{BLOCK:2}
"They say smokers damage non smokers' health and shit.@ They even go as far as declaring it a violation of human rights.@ Now, I'd like to ask them, what about SMOKERS' human rights, huh?@"
This sounds pretty egotistical, but I guess that's yet another of my uncle's jokes.#

{BLOCK:3}
"That said, I understand we teachers are hypocritical life guides that drill in your heads "don't smoke, don't smoke" and then we vape like chimneys in the office."@>
"Uncle, what did you want to talk about...?"@>
His soliloquy never ends, so I cut the chase.@>
"Nh?@ Oh, yeah..."@>
{CHARA:r51}
He throws the cigarette he just lit a moment ago to the floor and steps on it to put out the fire.@ Then...@>
"That incident on Monday was a real jaw-dropper, wasn't it?"@>
He says out of the blue.\

"Monday?@ You mean Ohta's incident?"@>
"She's from your class, right?"@>
"Yes, she sits diagonally to me."@>
"Were you friends with that girl?"@>
"No, not really..."@>
I answer as unconcernedly as if I were being questioned by a police officer.\

{BLOCK:5}
"She's from your class, so I take you know a lot about her, don't you?"@>
"Know what?"@>
"Rumors and such."@>
"Yes, I heard all sort of things about her, but those were all groundless gossips."@>
"What "gossips", specifically?"@>
My uncle peeks into my eyes.#
