"I heard that she was always neurotic."@>
"Yeah, that sounds credible."@>
My uncle smiles awkwardly.@>
"From a layman's point of view, one would normally associate a student's mental breakdown with nervous disorders caused by stress, meaning, neurosis.@ Under that perspective, the origin of her insanity could be traced back to problems in her daily life.@ The press in particular tends to emphasize that line of thought.@ They'd argue she was likely a victim of bullying at school, and that the school's management was greatly at fault..."#

Unintentionally, I picture crazy-driven Ohta in my mind.@>
She was a top member of the student council.@ If I recall correctly, the vice president.@>
She was bright, optimistic, and was always surrounded by a bunch of girls.@ She had a lot of friends, too.@ It's like she lived a in different world than me.#

{BLOCK:2}
"Ohta had nothing to do with bullying, stress or anything of the sort.@ I don't believe she suffered from neurosis."@>
Without even realizing it, I find myself defending her like a lawyer.@ That's probably due to the closeness I've been feeling towards her since the day of the incident.#

"Exactly.@ After investigating a bit, I found nothing in her domestic or school life that could potentially trigger neurosis.@ She was doing well at school, and she had almost no troubles family-wise.@ That's why we're looking for the main cause in other aspects of her life."#

{BLOCK:4}
"Does that mean you have ruled out the possibility of family and school issues?"@>
"Yeah, pretty much.@ I'm only making conjectures, though.@ I have the strong suspicion that were other factors involved.@ What other rumors did you hear?"#
