"They say she consumed illicit substances."@>
"Hmm, judging by the state she was on Monday, she showed all the typical symptoms of a drug addict."@>
"So she was doing drugs, after all?"@>
Unintentionally, I furrow my brows.#

{BLOCK:1}
"No, we only suspected that."@>
My uncle coughs.@>
"In psychiatry, psychosis is classified into several categories.@ Alcoholic psychosis, organic psychosis, and of course drug psychosis."@>
"I see..."#

{BLOCK:2}
"And obviously we had the docs examine her."@>
"What was the diagnosis?"@>
My uncle drops his head slowly.@>
"According to the check-up they ran at the hospital...@ Oh, by the way, she's still hospitalized in a general hospital, but they didn't find a single trace of substances inside her body."#

{BLOCK:3}
"Then the cause lies in another place entirely, right?@ Perhaps she was cornered by a problem her family and friends never knew about."@>
"That's plausible.@ Mental issues are a thing from the mind, though, so we can't take any conclusions as unconditionally true.@ Just because her breakdown happened AFTER a certain incident that doesn't mean the cause was THAT incident.@ Perhaps said event was only the last straw that broke her, and the actual source of the problem was always rooted inside her as potential neurosis."#

{BLOCK:4}
"That said, if we keep following that line of thought we'd only be walking in circles forever, so we want to focus the investigation on what we actually CAN investigate.@ Anyway, what other rumors did you hear?"@>
He asks me, and I try to recall any other gossips.#
