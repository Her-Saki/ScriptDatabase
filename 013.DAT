"What are you trying to make me do?@ I have a feeling that you're about to give me a bothersome task."@>
"Hmm, you're sharp.@ That's exactly what I was aiming for.@ I'll tell you the details later, but for now, just answer my questions."@>
My uncle laughs as if he's plotting something up his sleeve.@>
Whenever he smiles like that, nothing good is bound to happen.#

{BLOCK:1}
"So, Yuusuke, what do you think after reading the diary?"@>
Letting out a sigh, I let my gaze run across the note once more.#

{BLOCK:2}
2/3 - Today I'm not going to school.@ Despite it's Sunday, third year teachers showed themselves at work.@ They'll stay at office until late night, so today I won't go.@>
I can't stand it.@>
I can't stand it.@>
How can the other girls endure this?!@>
I'm going straight to his home.#

{BLOCK:3}
"What could "can't stand it" mean?"@>
"You mean from the note?"@>
I suddenly go back to the subject, and my uncle cracks a perplexed, awkward smile.@>
"At first glance we thought it was related to drugs, but that wasn't the case, so we suspect she's talking about having sex with her boyfriend or someone else."@>
If the diagnosis they ran at the hospital was correct, then that's the most logical conclusion.@>
My uncle's reasoning is very solid.#

{BLOCK:4}
However, there are still some loose threads left.@>
"But, umm...@ Can someone reach a drug addict-like state just from sex abstinence?"@>
I can't express my opinion firmly.@ After all, that's something only experienced know about...@>
"Well, that depends on the person.@ It's not unthinkable for a high school girl to have a sexual drive higher than the average, and it'd be even more common if we talk about nowadays' girls."#

{BLOCK:5}
"Aside from March 2nd, Ohta always left for school, right?@ Can we conclude she stayed up every night until late hours doing that kind of thing?"@>
"Yeah, pretty much."@>
"Why it had to be specifically at school?@ She could have chosen a hotel or her own house."@>
"Hotels cost money, and at home her family would suspect.@ On the other hand, the school is close and no one stays at night.@ It's pretty convenient if you see it that way."@>
My uncle's rationale is sound, but I still feel something's not right.#

{BLOCK:6}
"Perhaps doing it at school turned her on."@>
"Are you implying she was a pervert...?"@>
"Given this document, anything is possible.@ We'd know right away if she wasn't SO reputable, though."@>
A wicked smile appears on my uncle's face.#

{BLOCK:7}
"So let's assume Ohta was a sexual deviant and had intercourse every night at school.@ Does that mean she lost her mind just because a single day of abstinence as her diary shows?"@>
"No, perhaps I forgot to mention it, but when it comes to psychatric illnesses, we can't establish any direct cause.@ However, it's very likely that her abstinence acted as a trigger for the downfall that led to her breakdown.@ The medics didn't find any substances inside her, but there's also a possibility that she used to drink alcohol on a regular basis."#

{BLOCK:8}
"I know, but..."@>
Let's say, for the sake of argument, that every deduction my uncle said is true and correct.@>
That means I knew only a portion of Ohta's true self.@>
Despite I have no concern regarding her personality, I can't help but picture Ohta as the OPPOSITE of a pervert or a skank.@>
But of course, that's merely my personal opinion.#

{BLOCK:9}
"Let's say, and this is just a hypothesis..."@>
My uncle coughs out a lungful of smoke.@>
"That Kanako met with a boy in secret (probably a student from our school) every night at school to have sex.@ That'd be a HUGE problem for the school management.@ However, there's something even worse written in this note."@>
I return my gaze to the note as he says this.#

{BLOCK:10}
"How can the other girls endure this?!"#

{BLOCK:11}
"Here it says "other girls"."@>
"Does that mean there's more people other than Ohta coming to school secretly?"@>
"Yeah.@ Judging by her wording, Ohta's not the only one participating in these meetings."@>
{CHARA:r51}
My uncle throws the cropped cigarette at his feet and treads on it with the toe of his shoe.@ That's the second cigarette butt of the day.#

{BLOCK:12}
"In short, a boy and a girl are using our sacred school every night as a hotel.@ That alone is material for a big scandal, but to add insult to injury, it turns out that they're a GROUP of teenagers making wild sexual parties.@ It sounds totally like the plot of a B-tier TV show."#

{BLOCK:13}
"And Ohta's mental breakdown makes it even worse, doesn't it?"@>
"Remember that we talked about rape?"@>
"Yes."@>
"What we're really worried about is if rape is thrown into the mix.@ That'd turn this mess into a full-fledged criminal case.@ If that's really what's going on, we better gotta brace ourselves for the shitstorm."#

{BLOCK:14}
"And how's the school dealing with this?@ I figure they won't tell the police in order to avoid making the scandal public, but, are you investigating alone?"@>
"No, there's several people involved.@ We patrolled the school at night taking turns."@>
"You did nightly rounds?@ How did that go?"@>
"We found nothing.@ It was a complete waste of time."@>
"What if that group stops gathering after what happened to Ohta?"#

{BLOCK:15}
"I hope so..."@>
My uncle says with a deep sigh.@>
"One of her partners suffered a mental breakdown and was hospitalized, and the school has started investigating the matter, so I believe they won't act careless from now on."@>
"That's right, but remember what was written in Kanako's diary..."#

{BLOCK:16}
"Despite it's Sunday, third year teachers presented themselves at work.@ They'll stay at office until late night..."#

{BLOCK:17}
"They're keeping an eye on us, the teachers.@ Perhaps our investigation was leaked to them.@ In fact, last night the athletics club stayed up late and a girl witnessed some suspicious shadows lurking in the area."@>
This has become totally a detective show.\c

{BLOCK:18}
"And that's where you enter the stage."@>
Suddenly, my uncle raises the tone of his voice and looks at me directly.@>
"Would you help me investigate the case?"#

{BLOCK:19}
"Huh?"@>
I ask back.@>
"I think it'd best if someone that wouldn't stand out late at school, like a student, investigates.@ That'd be you."@>
This is a bit too abrupt.@>
"I understand your point, but..."@>
I'm at a loss for words.#
