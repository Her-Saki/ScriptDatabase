"Okay, I accept."@>
I mutter in a low voice.@>
After hearing that, my uncle pats my shoulders with a smile of satisfaction.@>
"You'll do it?@ Good."@>
"But please don't expect a great job from me.@ They'll be wary of me even if I'm only a student."@>
"This investigation is based merely on my guesses and conjectures, so just survey things a bit and if you find nothing, then leave it there.@ As long as the upper echelon gets a satisfactory answer, we're gold."#

{BLOCK:1}
My uncle taps my shoulders again.@>
"Once the inspection is done, I'll pay you for the part-time job you did.@ The cheap pay of a local public officer."@>
"Thank you..."@>
"If there's something you don't know, just drop by my desk at the office.@ I usually spent my free time drinking coffee or smoking there.@ You already know the phone number of my house, don't you?"@>
"Yes, I do."#

{BLOCK:2}
"Nice.@ Can you start tonight?"@>
"Not a problem on my end, but...@ Oh, by the way..."@>
"What is it?"@>
"If you have another clue, please tell me."@>
"I think I already told you everything I know..."@>
"You said a girl of the athletics club saw some suspicious, human-like shadows.@ Could you tell me her name?"@>
"Ah, it's Shinjo from the female volleyball club.@ Saori Shinjo.@ If I recall correctly, she's from 2-D class..."#

{BLOCK:3}
Saori Shinjo, volleyball club, 2-D class.@ Got it.@>
I should ask her some info for reference.#

{BLOCK:4}
"Ah, I should explain to you how to enter the school entrance by night."@>
"Oh, yes, that's important."@>
"The front entrance is linked to a security company, and in order to enter you need a key and a security code.@ The code for the door is 0824.@ That's the day the school was founded, August 24th.@ Use the mnemonic device "weight, plenty for" to remember it.@>
""Weight, plenty for", huh?@ 
"Yeah."@>
I feel bad for my uncle, but I find it easier to just remember "0824".\c

At that moment, the warning bell for the afternoon classes rings.@>
It's 12:55.@>
"Oh, would you look at the time..."@>
My uncle looks at his wristwatch.#

{BLOCK:7}
"Anyway, if you have any question, come to my desk anytime."@>
"Yes, you got it."@>
"Alright, I'm counting on you."@>
{CHARA:r99}
My uncle says turning his back to me.@>
"Sure.@ I'll be looking forward to that part-time job pay."@>
My uncle startles a bit with my reminder, but shrugs and waves to me as he leaves.\c
