*Ding-Dong-Ding-Dong!*#

{BLOCK:1}
The bell rings marking the beginning of the final class of the day.@>
{BGMFOUT}
{BGMNEXT:02}
{BG:019912}
Amidst the eerie silence of the classroom, an emotionless teacher reads a text in a language I don't comprehend.@>
The sound of the students running their pens across their notebooks mixes with the sound of the teacher hitting the blackboard with the chalk.#

{BLOCK:2}
This looks exactly like a funeral.@>
What I'm hearing is the national language of the country that beat Japan in the war.@>
The native tongue of the nation that crushed ours incinerating tens of thousands of its people with nukes.@>
If we're forced to learn their language now is because countless persons were nuked to death in the war; because their demises led to Japan's defeat.@>
It's a funeral.@>
A funeral for the tens of thousands of people who were burned to extinction by the nukes.#

{BLOCK:3}
I hear a sutra.@>
A long...@ long...@ s@u@t@r@a...#

{BLOCK:4}
I feel the world bends itself effortlessly.#

Mizuho's standing before me.@>
She's staring at me with an anxious look.@>
"Why did Kanako lose her mind?",@>
she asks feebly.#

{BLOCK:6}
"She was driven mad",@>
I answer.@>
"By who?@ Who drove Kanako mad?@ Who drove my dear Kanako mad?!@>
"Who, you ask?"@>
I laugh.#

{BLOCK:7}
"Everyone.@>
Eve-@ry-@one.@>
See all those people around us?@>
It was that guy, and that other guy, and that guy too, and he, she, you, I..."\c
{CHARA:c26}
\e

{BLOCK:8}
"No, I didn't!"@>
"Everybody did the same, no exceptions.@>
All of them, nemine contradicente, told her:"#

{BLOCK:9}
Get crazy,@ get crazy,@ get crazy,@ get crazy,@ get crazy,@ get crazy,@ GET CRAZY, GET CRAZY, GET CRAZY, GET CRAZY, GET CRAZY, GET CRAZY, GET CRAZY, GET CRAZY, GET CRAZY, GET CRAZY, GET CRAZY, GET CRAZY, GET CRAZY...#

{BLOCK:10}
That guy, and that guy, and that guy there, and that other guy too...@>
You, I, the dogs, the cats, the cars, the planes, the air, the sun...#

{BLOCK:11}
Everyone and everything kept repeating her to death:#

{BLOCK:12}
GET CRAZY, GET CRAZY, GET CRAZY, GET CRAZY, GET CRAZY, GET CRAZY, GET CRAZY, GET CRAZY, GET CRAZY, GET CRAZY, GET CRAZY, GET CRAZY...\c
{CHARA:c24}
\e

{BLOCK:13}
"So that's why Kanako lost herself?"@>
Mizuho says as her eyes become cloudy.@>
Just like a little child spooked by a jumpscare video, Mizuho cowers covering her ears with both hands.\c
{CHARA:c99}
\e

{BLOCK:14}
GET CRAZY, GET CRAZY, GET CRAZY, GET CRAZY, GET CRAZY, GET CRAZY, GET CRAZY, GET CRAZY, GET CRAZY, GET CRAZY, GET CRAZY, GET CRAZY...\c
{CHARA:c00}
\e

{BLOCK:15}
"Let's embrace insanity, Naga."@>
Out of the blue, Ruriko appears standing in the place Mizuho was crouching in fear before, and speaks with a pure, innocent smile on her face.#

{BLOCK:16}
"Can I... lose my mind too?@ Just like you and Ohta?"@>
Ruriko notices I hesitate to give a positive answer, and her eyes become icy with contempt.@>
"Are you scared?@ Hmph, what a coward."#

{BLOCK:17}
A twinge of pain stings my heart.@>
Not because she's making fun of me, but because she's LOOKING DOWN on me.\c
{CHARA:c03}
\e

{BLOCK:18}
"Well, it doesn't matter."@>
Ruriko laughs once again.@>
"You'll go crazy sooner or later anyway."#

{BLOCK:19}
Then, I feel the world twists and warps once again...#

{BLOCK:20}
{BGMFOUT}

{BGMPLAY:02}
Amidst the eerie silence of the classroom, an emotionless teacher reads a text in a language I don't comprehend.@>
The sound of the students running their pens across their notebooks mixes with the sound of the teacher hitting the blackboard with the chalk.#

{BLOCK:21}
My shirt glues to my sweaty skin,@>
and my heart is beating so fast my chest hurts.#

{BLOCK:22}
That pitch-black shadow inside me draws away very, very slowly.@>
Static bites my brain as if electric current ran through my head.@>
It's the same sensation as when Ruriko held my hand.#

{BLOCK:23}
"It's just like receiving radio signals."#

{BLOCK:24}
The door to the world of insanity is right before me.@>
I can't wait to open it wide and jump into it at once.#
