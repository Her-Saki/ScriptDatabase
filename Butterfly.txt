Have you ever been bitten by an bee? If so, what did you feel as the insect stung your skin? Pain? Fright? Or perhaps... pleasure?
Personally, the first thing I felt as that butterfly gnawed at my arm was a dose of pain I couldn't describe with any adjective other than "sweet". While usually butterflies are not known exactly for biting, this one had clearly visible fangs in her small, cherry-colored mouth.
"Her?", you may rightly ask, and yeah, I'm fully convinced this butterfly was the reincarnation of a woman, or rather, a young girl whose hatred towards the world knew no limit.
After all, besides her immaculate teeth, she had red human-like eyes burning with fury. The most beautiful eyes I've ever seen.
*Spluck*, she stabbed her fangs into my flesh. A fleeting spark of sexual gratification ran through my blood, tickling my heart, my stomach... and my soul.
I read her memories through the DNA she poured into my cells, and those are what I'll be describing here.
Soon after, however, she flew away, never to return again.
She...
An angel of absolute freedom...
and a demon of insane willpower.
<---------------->
Today I woke up feeling strangely fresh. A clarity I've only experienced after indulging in a certain kind of self-gratification.
Resting on the bed, I move my arm in front of my face.
There, the crimson scar left by a weird butterfly that bit me yesterday stands quietly, illuminated by the sunlight coming from outside the window.
I've never heard of butterflies biting people, but I guess it's not *that* weird. Perhaps it was an uncommon species of butterfly or something. Googling it didn't help, though.
Anyway, I get out of bed, change into my school uniform, and climb down the stairs that lead towards the living room.
"Guten morgen!"
From the kitchen, I hear the voice of my little sister greeting me with her usual bright voice.
"Hello, Kirika."
I return her greeting as I take seat before the table.
In front of it, a news flash is being broadcast on TV.
<In other news, Shinjuku's serial murder case knows no stop: a new victim has been found dead in her apartment in the 4th avenue, raising the victim count to a new all-time high of 23 in the district...>
*ZIUUUM*
Suddenly, the TV is turned off.
"Sheesh, I told you countless times before to turn off the TV while we have breakfast, didn't I? Watching the news is bad for my delicate heart."
"Oh, you're right. Sorry", I reply joining my hands with a smile.
This girl that often talks like she's a high-class lady (she isn't) is my little sister, Kirika. A short lady that loves to cook more than anything.
While I call her my "little sister", we're not actually related by blood.
She lost her parents when she was 9 years old, and since we were best friends since kinder, she came to live with me. She's 15 now, and I'm 18.
Naturally, we received severe backlash from our school and from the neighborhood community for this decision, but fortunately, her uncle that works as a lawyer helped her to make the process legal.
We're still seen as "freaks" of sorts (the mildest thing we've been called up to the date) everywhere we go, but we actually treasure our "siblings" relationship and haven't taken it further than that.
Of course, I'm not expecting any outsider to understand it, but I often wonder if she wouldn't be happier with me out of the way...
"Alright, the breakfast is ready."
After making a round trip to the kitchen, she serves two steaming miso soup bowls on the table, and takes seat right in front of me.
"Let's eat!", we say in unison, and start eating.
"So, Kirika, have you found a boyfriend yet?", I ask.
*Pfft!*, Kirika almost spits the soup from her mouth.
"W-What are you even saying?! I-I'm not gonna do that sort of things until I marry!"
"Oh, okay. Good girl, good girl."
I stroke her hair. That innocent side of hers is very cute, but I feel like she'll lose it sooner than later.
"Geez, stop doing that! I'm not a little kid anymore, you know!"
"I know, I know", I say as I keep messing with her hair.
"Don't push your luck, Kazuka!"
And then we laugh together.
"But still... it's been already 6 years since we started living together, right?"
"Yeah... A lot happened during this time."
Awful things like the audiences in the family court... Bullying at school... The hateful glares of our neighbors...
But also happy things like trips to Hokkaido, birthday parties, and family breakfasts like these.
"Anyway, I hope we'll create good memories from now on too."
"Yes!", she says with a cheerful smile, and goes back to eat her soup.
When it's already 7:05, we both look at the small tower clock on the TV cabinet and decide it's time to move on.
"Oops, time to go to school! C'mon, Kazuka, hurry up!"
"Oh, you're right. Gotta get going."
I finish my breakfast in a single gulp and quickly stand up from my chair.
I enter the toilet room and get out as fast as I can after combing my hair.
Kirika opens the door first, and we get outside.
The pale blue sky spreads everywhere in this fine morning of April.
Chilly wind blows past us as we walk together towards the first corner to the right of our apartment, and we stop there.
This is the place where we usually part ways.
"Well, good luck with school, Kirika."
"Take care you too, Kazuka!"
I watch her leave as she waves back at me repeatedly, until she's nowhere to be seen.
A minute or so later the bus arrives, and I hop into the entrance door.
The driver, an overweight 45 years old man with a face akin to a sleepy bulldog, makes a disgruntled gesture which I (have to) interpret as a greeting.
After pushing my bus card into the machine and hearing the "ding!" sound that signals a successful payment, I head straight to my usual seat in the bottom row.
Despite we see each other almost every morning, we passengers haven't developed anything even remotely close to a human connection.
Should enough time pass, for example, I'd hardly remember the face of the fatso that always peeks into the skirt of the girls in the first row of seats pretending to read the newspaper, or the face of the junkie snorting coke in a corner of the last row.
I bet they're not even aware of my existence, either.
Everybody's too busy with their own life to care about what others do.
That's only natural.
That common notion of humans being "social beings" is just a convenient made-up concept used to hide the hard truth that we are, by nature, the most individualist living beings on the planet Earth. Should you provide any person on this bus with consistent food, shelter, sex and entertainment, they probably won't give a flinch at hearing that a gory war broke out at the other side of the world.
In the end, we're nothing more than simple animals with entertainment added to our list of basic needs, and laziness as one of our distinctives qualities.
*And in the skies, far from the dirt, you'll find...*
The buzzing ring of a melody leaks out from the cheap-looking headphones of the girl by my side.
Quite a beauty, I have to admit.
Orange hair, blue eyes, pale skin, perfect aligned nose...
Yeah, she's without a shadow of doubt a foreigner. She wears the uniform of Kuro high so I guess she attends the same school as me, but I've never seen her before, much less on *this* bus.
She's typing something in her phone.
"E"... "Eye"? I'm reading the word "eye" there, but what's next? "Ne... phi..."?
"Got a problem, bud?"
Noticing I'm staring at her phone, the foreign girl turns her face to me and asks me what the hell I'm doing in perfect Japanese, with a displeased look on her face.
"Oh, s-sorry."
"Tsk."
Clicking her tongue, she turns back to her phone and starts typing again.
Hmm... "Fuckin"... "Idiot"... "Bus"...
Hey, that's rude. For starters, it's not like I can *not* stare when you're SO clo--...
"Can you fucking stop?"
This time the girl throws a dead-serious glance at me, but fortunately, the bus stops right there and she quickly stands up.
Or rather, I'd say *we* stand up, since I get up too.
This is the school's bus stop.
Feeling suddenly awkward, I walk step by step hesitantly until exiting the bus.
Once outside, we walk side by side towards the school...
"......"
"......"
but we don't exchange a single word during our long, uncomfortable march.
Then, we part ways in the shoe lockers near the entrance.
Hmm, this is usually the place where girls meet with her friends as soon as they enter school, but she walks straight to the classrooms without greeting anybody.
Well, that's nothing of my concern.
I should go ahead and get to my classroom too.
Just like her, I walk along the hallway without greeting anybody, but for a different reason.
I'm treated like a "freak" of sorts, so people don't really look at me or greet me at all.
It's just like being invisible.
That's not without its benefits though.
For example, I never get called out by the teacher to read texts out loud, and also I'm basically ruled out of the attendance list. I could probably skip 90% of the classes and (maybe) still be fine.
I open the door of my classroom, and there,
"Yo, Kazuka."
my best friend Hitoshi greets me with a smile.
...... Hitoshi?
"Hi, Satoshi."
For a brief instant, I mistook his name in my head.
I-I can't believe it! I better not tell him about that blunder, or he'll complain all day long about what a terrible friend I am.
Satoshi is a short-haired, easygoing guy who's always into something new: yesterday was gunpla models, and today could be anything ranging from quantum physics to PC dating simulators.
"Man, what's up with that face? You look like you've seen a freakin' ghost!"
"Oh, haha, no, actually..."
And I start to tell him what happened in the bus.
"Hmm..."
"... Yeah?"
I await his take, when...
"She's an spy sent from an european Masonic group to keep track on you, and she's acting aloof in order to catch you off guard!"
"What the--?!"
He makes a conspiracy theory out of the one-minute long story I told him some seconds ago.
"Haha! Of course I'm kidding! You're not even remotely interesting to deserve such a cool plot twist!"
"......"
"Oh, pay him no mind. He just consumed too much sugar this morning."
"Hey, my relationship with sugar is none of your business!"
Behind him is my only other friend in the entire school: Hiroko.
She's a gyaru that likes everything fashionable, and acts like the tsukkomi part of the comedic duo she shares with Satoshi.
Unfortunately, she separated from her friends when she decided to ally with me (with a long, loud, violent argument in between), but that's something I'd be forever grateful for.
My school life wouldn't be the same without them.
"By the way, Hirako... I mean, Hiroko..."
Huh? Again?
"Hirako?! Who's that?! Is she prettier than her flat-chested sister Hiro--?!"
"I'M HEARING YOU!"
*Zap*, a lightning-fast rubber bullet hits Satoshi in the back of his head.
He promptly turns around and replies:
"Owww! I'll remember this before throwing you a lifesaver in an exam..."
"Shove it up your ass!"
*Zap!*
Another bullet traveling at 300 million mph strikes Satoshi, but this time in his forehead.
"That's it! No more lifesavers for you!"
"Bleh!", she sticks out her tongue.
"But still, what's going on in your head, man? I know she's flat as a board and as rude and foul-mouthed as a sailor, but forgetting her name is just going too far, don'tcha think?"
"Saaa... tooo... shiii...!"
"Yeah, my bad. I don't know what is wrong me today..."
"Well, everyone has one of *those* days, I guess", he shrugs.
One of those days, huh?
Yeah, he's right. This is just an unlucky day for me.
Tomorrow will be better, I hope.
"Anyhow, take seat before the teacher arrives!", she says.
I left myself fall into my chair, and soon after, classes begin.
Before the blackboard, a bald, bored teacher reads out a text while the equally bored students pretend to listen to him.
In this small cell of the small, temporary prison we call "school", we all carry on with this farce every day for the sake of keeping appeareances and avoid being socially punished. We'd all rather be doing *anything* else, yet we're here taking part in this collective sham that is compulsory education.
It's no use to ponder about it, though. As long as it helps to avoid conflict, it's preferable to be pretending to study over doing any kind of actual hard work.
<---------------->
"Hey, Kazu."
During a break, Hira... I mean, Hiroko stares at me with a perplexed gaze.
"What's wrong with your hair? It looks funny..."
"? My hair?"
I don't recall seeing anything weird with my hair before the mirror this morning.
While it's far from tidy, I didn't notice any sprung up or disarranged bangs.
"Here. Take a look."
She takes out a pocket-sized mirror from her school bag and hands it to me.
There, I see two small antenna-like strands of hair springing up. Like ahoge, but in real life.
"Haha... What the hell..."
I can't help but smile awkwardly.
"How come I didn't notice it before?"
"Hahaha... You look just like an ant."
I try to bring them down, but they bounce up back.
They feel... strangely solid to the touch.
I realize I've frozen in place.
... Why, though?
Why antennae, of all things?
Yesterday, that butterfly...
Nah, no way.
It's just a silly coincidence.
I know it's nothing more than that, but...
But for some reason, a pearl-shaped sweatdrop leaks slowly across my temple.
"Uh, is not that terrible of a thing, man."
"Hm? What do you mean?"
"Yeah, like, you're sweating a lot. Like you runned up a marathon twice. Look below you."
I follow Satoshi's finger, and discover a small pool of sweat on my lap and the chair.
They both stare at me concernedly.
"Um, you've been acting a little weird today. Are you okay?"
"Y-Yeah..."
Of course.
Aided by the post-bite clarity, I soon realize the reason behind my amnesia.
I *do not need* to know their names.
They're merely slaves of her own ignorance. They hold no value as individuals, so names are superflous identifiers. They should be freed from their hollow existence through forced evolution. That is indeed a most pressing issue, for we are...
"Ack!"
A twinge of pain bites my head.
I can feel physically the blood running through the veins in my brain. An awareness I didn't know it was even possible.
"Hey!", Hiroko screams.
"Sorry, I gotta go now."
Holding my head, I exit the classroom and then the school with tottering steps in order to head for the bus stop.
Fortunately (?), since I'm practically invisible at school, nobody stops me on my way towards the gates.
Looking at my wristwatch, I notice that the bus is only 10 minutes away from stopping here.
Huf...
My breathing becomes heavy.
The people passing before me start looking gradually like shadows detached from reality. Like subjects devoid of any relevant, individual characteristics. NPCS in a videogame that you can **** without a care in the world and WHOA, that babe's smoking hot. I should hook her up with some romantic BS and ask her her number and take her up to a motel and ban--
HUF... HUF...
I need water.
I'd KILL for a glass of water.
I've not feeling well today, really.
Huh? Hook up who? What the hell?
I'm not that kind of guy.
I don't know what's wrong with me today, but...
Okay, first off, calm down. This is just a bad day.
Breath in... Exhale... Breath in... Exhale...
Alright.
As I try to deceive myself into thinking I've regained composure, the bus arrives.
There, the usual obese driver becomes surprised upon looking at my, presumably, sick pale face.
"Hey, chum, you ok?", he asks as I struggle to climb up the three-step stairs in the bus entrance.
"......"
"Shouldn't ya be at school at this time o' day?"
"......"
I don't answer.
No, that's not quite correct.
I CAN'T answer.
I feel like there's something viscous and sticky stuck in my throat that doesn't let words come out.
It feels horrible... but I must be patient until I reach home.
I grab one of the poles near the middle-row seats.
Perhaps frightened by my (presumably) indisposed appearance, a little kid below me sitting on the lap of his mother throws brief upwards glances at me.
Damn, I snaked out of school...
I can't believe I did that, but I couldn't stand a single second longer there.
"......"
The static noise coming from the streets outside combined with the unintelligible mumbling of the people inside the bus and the sound of the bus forging ahead form a sort of comfortable lullaby that induces me to a state of drowsiness.
If I relax even for a second, I could probably fall asleep here and now, but I should wait until reaching home.
Or that's what I thought when, unexpectedly, a voice starts echoing in my head.
|**** them.|
Huh?
|**** them.|
......
|**** them.|
"Shut... up..."
|*** them.|
"Shut up..."
|Spill their **** and **** their *******| Make them a sacrifice befitting our sacred Mother of Absolute Chaos!
"SHUT THE FUCK UP, GODDAMIT!"
The people on the bus fall all at once into a dead silence.
Without exception, they look at me with surprised looks on their faces, but after some seconds of opressive stillness, the bus stops.
"S-Sorry..."
When I take off my hand from the rail, I notice the sweat dripping from it formed a small puddle on the floor.
I walk with unsteady steps towards the exit, and almost trip on my way out.
"H-Hey..."
I hear the concerned voice of the driver behind me.
HUF... HUF... HUF...
I feel... terrible.
I don't think I've had a worst day in my entire life.
I just want it to end as soon as possible.
Get home, throw myself in bed, tell Kirika to prepare some soup...
Yeah, Kirika...
I wanna ser face.
I probably won't die for this, but I need to see her now more than ever.
"......"
The walk towards home feels like an endless calvary.
Nausea wells up in my throat, and I feel like I could throw up any moment now.
As I totter between people and avoid bumping into them, they look at me severely weirded out. This time not for my relationship with Kirika, but by my demeanor typical of a patient that should be in a hospital rather than the street.
Exhausted, I reach the door of my apartment.
I try to knock, but it's in vain. It seems Kirika hasn't arrived home yet.
I feel in my pocket for my keys... but they aren't there.
I guess I lost them. Will have to wait for Kirika to come back with her spare key...
Was she going to be late today? I don't remember...
Or rather, I don't have any spare energy to *think* right now.
Reaching the limit of my exhaustion, I let myself fall to the ground.
Then, I sink into a comfortable sleep.
<------------------->
"Hey, get up. What are you doing here? Did you get drunk or something?"
I hear a deep voice trying to wake me up shaking me by the shoulders.
I open my eyes, and there, I see... KIMURA.
"You're late in your payment, did you know that? You shouldn't go partying like that when you have responsibilities to fulfill."
I get up with great difficulty.
Yeah. This MAN. My "lanlord". The MAN who charges me 50000 yen monthly for living here. He comes here every month to claim the residents' payment, but he lives in a PH a few miles from here.
I've observed him once get kicked out of a hostess club for drinking too much and groping one of the girls.
Why, though? Why should pay this HUMAN for shelter?
Why should I work to help him to live comfortably?
That's illogical. Such relationship doesn't hold any meaning.
I'm stronger than him, after all.
I approach the HUMAN named Kimura, who looks at me perplexed.
"Hm? Is something the matter?"
A fragile HUMAN body like his won't stand a chance against a fall from this 5th floor, so...
<NO! STOP!>
I take him by the armpits and lift him a couple of centimeters over the ground, then simply carry him to the handrail.
"H-Hey, what the hell are you...?"
He tries in vain to punch my head and kick me, but it's no use.
Not only his attacks are weak; he's so scared he's not even focusing on being aggresive.
Also, I've cut by 50% my sense of pain, so his strikes feel little stronger than mosquito bites.
<STOPSTOPSTOP!>
I drop him as I observe the expression of terror drawn on his face.
Well, that is only natural.
For a HUMAN about to die, that is.
<STOPPPPPPPPP!>
*CRACK!*
A sound similar to crushing a watermelon with a bat echoes from the first floor of the apartment.
Well... that was stupid easy.
Why didn't I do this before?
I don't get it. 
<"......!">
This HUMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
I throw up.
I fall to the floor over my own puke and cry my eyes away for what it feels like an eternity.
A weeping requiem to the last traces of rationality smashed to pieces by ME.
<------------------->
Walking down the street, I spot an attractive female on the sidewalk.
"Oh?"
A young girl, huh?
I recall seeing this in a comic book before.
In the story, an obese man stopped a girl in the street and offered her some sheets of paper called "money" in order to reproduce with her.
Why not, though? It looks entertaining.
I approach the girl. Judging by her appeareance, she looks healthy enough.
Fair, spotless skin...
Well-sized breasts...
Wide hips ideal to conceive children...
I proceed to stand before her and ask her:
"Hello. Would you like to reproduce with me?"
"......!"
For some reason, she startles and looks at me up and down.
"Uh, excuse me?"
It seems she didn't hear clearly my question, so I repeat:
"Do you want to procreate with me? I have "money"."
"With YOU? Hah! Fat chance. Fuck off, loser."
I don't understand the reason behind her refusal.
All I asked was to reproduce our species with her...
Are all HUMAN girls like this?
If such is the case, then chances are I will not get another opportunity to procreate anytime soon.
I have no choice to restort to force.
I approach the girl from behind.
Perhaps hearing my footsteps, she turns around.
"Huh?@ What the--? Eeek!"
From behind, I cover her mouth with my hand and take her to a nearby alley so that no other HUMANS hear her screams and interrupt our act.
".....!"
Hm? This HUMAN GIRL is weak. *Very* weak.
Her resistance doesn't represent any problem for ME to hold her.
I don't understand.
I am still a virgin, so why didn't I do this before?
It's literally the easiest way to reproduce.
First KIMURA, and now this...@ I fail to comprehend the irrationality behind MY previous actions.
Anyway, onto the act.
"Ngh!"
I take my hand to her pants to unbotton it, but just before I reach it...
"Mmgh!@"
*Stab!*
"Argh!"
Unexpectedly, I feel a sharp pain in my right shoulder.
I quickly look to my right, and there, the shiny edge of a steel blade emerges from a bleeding, dark crimson wound.
And next, a precise kick to my temple makes me fall to a side.
*THUD*
Once thrown out of the shadows, I take a look at the HUMAN behind this abrupt attack.
It's a girl in a high school uniform.
In a swift motion, she grabs my arm with a strenght unthinkable of a teenager girl, rolls up my sleeve, and quickly takes out a small needle that she injects into a vein of my exposed arm.
<------------------->
".....!"
All of a sudden, I feel like I just woke up from a hazy nightmare.
My right shoulder is covered in bandages.
I take a look around and observe a girl crying and cowering in the shadows below the bridge, and another girl wearing Kuro high's uniform standing before me... with a Beretta 9mm in hand.
W-What the hell happened here...?
".....!"
Agh!
All at once, memories from the past day flood into my mind like a broken dam.
Did... Did I do ALL that?!
A feeling of instant regret like I've never experienced before assaults me.
I... I've killed a... per--
"Listen."
The cold voice of the redhead foreign girl rings in my ears like a faraway, nonsensical echo.
"I'll make this brief: You've been infected by an alien parasite. You'll eventually become a creature similar to a butterfly and assault people indiscriminately in order to reproduce."
"In... fected?"
That word doesn't hold any meaning for me now, but it still sounds abnormally displeasing.
Infected. I got infected. I got infected by a parasite and killed a person... against my own will?
Huh? Is that self-justification?
God... dammit...
"Yeah, it was probably the work of a Slavefly."
"Slavefly?", I repeat without thinking.
"Alien insects that possess a human host and combine their DNA with them to "live" inside them. They're usually fragile and easy to kill just like any other insects, but they become a threat once they parasitize a human. We call those parasitized host "Slavemen"."
I... I don't get what she's talking about or why am I here, but I feel the responsibility of knowing what's going on.
"Who sent them?"
"The Queen. A powerful alien parasyte that seeks to colonize the planet through the human species. Our organization, Nyuumon, seeks to destroy it."
"So you guys are fighting them."
I don't know what I'm asking anymore.
"Correct."
I can't. I can't deal with this. Too much stuff is happening all at once.
"Anyway, Kazuka, you have two pretty simple choices: come with me and fight for our organization, or die. We can't have a Slaveman like you running loose."
The girl looks at me with a glare devoid of all emotion.
"B-But..."
My consciousness fights to avoid declaring myself insane, but it's eventually defeated.
"That means I'm a... monster..."
"Yes", she replies coldly. "At some point your infection will inevitably reach terminal stage and we WILL have to kill you, so bear that in mind before deciding what to do. I'll give you 10 seconds."
I can't stand this anymore, so...
I...
1. Put this suffering to an end.
2. Accept her offer.

1.
I've killed a person.
I'm a... murderer.
Regardless of the reason, I've taken the life of an innocent human being; easily the worst act one can commit in a lifetime.
I've become everything I hated.
But not only that.
I've tried to assault this girl crying before me.
She, a student in my school and a person with a bright future ahead that I was about to destroy.
I almost ruin her life forever for my own egoistical desires.
That's unredeemable. Unforgivable.
I've crossed the point of no return.
I... I don't have any right to live anymore.
"......"
"So? What will you do?"
"......."
The silence looms heavily over me.
"Tsk... Okay."
*Click!* With my eyes closed, I heard the sound of the gun's safety lock being removed. A clicking sound that echoes in my head like the bells of a funeral ceremony.
"Bye-Bye".
I feel a cold, metallic cilinder pressed gently against my sweaty forehead.
No, wait, no.
No, no, no, NO, NO!
I don't wanna die...!
I DON'T WANNA D--!
Suddenly, along the loud burst of an explosion, the black color I was seeing with my eyelids closed turns into an undecipherable shade of darkness.
And finally, my consciousness shuts down like a TV powering off.

2.
"But... I've committed murder..."
"?", the girl looks at me perplexed.
"Do you mean that old man "you" threw off the staircase?"
"......"
"Sheesh, don't worry about that. He's alive. I've spotted him just when I reached here and called an ambulance. We humans don't die that easily, y'know?"
"So... I'm not a..."
"No, you're not a killer, Kazuka Nagasaki", she says giving a sigh. "That said, you should still serve a good 10 years in prison for attempted murder and breaking almost every bone in his body, though."
"......!"
I see...
So Mr. Kimura is alive.
I'm not... a murderer.
Huh? What is this?
Without even realizing it, tears are flowing down my cheeks.
They're tears of relief, I guess.
Even if I'm going to die now, I haven't commited an irreparable mistake.
I don't think I could have lived on knowing I took the life of an innocent person.
"Anyway, we gotta get going now. You and the other girl are going to come with me to Nyuumon's base to receive further treatment."
She says walking towards the girl still crouching in the shadows.
After coming out under the moonlight shouldered by the redhead girl, I observe she's covering her face in shame.
I can even spot some tears 
I... I almost damaged her.
I don't know how to pay for what my wrongdoing, but for now, all I can do is accepting the other girl's deal.
Then, looking casually at my side, I notice she's holding out her hand.
"My name is Aisling, by the way."
"... Kazuka."
"Yeah, I knew it."
"......"
"Hm? What are you waiting for?"
I look at her face, at her hand, and at her face again.
"... Sheesh, you're slow on the uptake, arent' you?"
She forcefully holds my hand and, still with the girl in her shouders, she jumps one... two... ten meters up to a ceiling.
...Huh?
"Uaaaah!"
She jumps from building to building as gracefully as a cat.
"Hold tight, because this will be a *long* one-way trip!"
We three leap into the dead of the night, towards a dark destiny of unknown denouement.
Will I become a monster... or will I get strong enough to overcome the demons inside me?
I don't know... but I've to do my best wherever Aisling takes me to.
Not only for me, but for the sake of the other girl... and Kirika too.
Praying in my heart that she'll be okay without me, I look up once again to the starless sky.
