` A dream.\
` I'm having a dream.@
` A dream where I brace myself as I shiver inside a dark room.\
` Confined in this dim, lightless room, I hold my knees while sitting on the cold floor.@ Pearl-like sweatdrops slide along my skin as I attempt desperately to pin down that THING that threatens to crawl out of me.@
` It's that kind of dream.\
` Haa, haa...@
` My breath is rough, like that of a carnivorous beast.@
` My whole body shakes as sweat flows down my skin.@
` I'm suffocating.@
` My head hurts so much I feel like it's about to be split apart.@
` Somebody...@ Somebody help me...@
` My lips form the words I want to say, but no sound comes from my throat.@
` Please, anybody...\
` Huhuhu.@
` How long will you keep doing that?\
` A suffocated laughter echoes through my head.\
` It's useless.@
` Futile.@
` Vain.@
` You'll never be able to suppress me.\
` Shut up!@
` I scream.@
` If I lose focus for only a second, HE will break out from that jail called "rationality" and leap out to the real world at once.@
` I dig my fingernails into my knees as I hold them between my arms.@
` I can't afford to lose.\
` Huhuhu, alright.@ You won tonight.@
` But, what will happen tomorrow?@
` And the day after tomorrow?@
` How long will you last without eating, drinking water, or sleeping?@
` It's all the same.@
` All the more when...\
` Shut the fuck up!\
` Huhuhu.@ Be honest; you already noticed it, didn't you?@
` You're fully aware that you've reached your limit.@
` You're fully aware that you can't take it anymore.@
` Come on, release me.@
` Let me free.@
` You're only postponing the inevitable.@
` That's the truth, so why are you suffering in vain?@
` Hm? What do you say?\
` No.
` No, no, no!
` I can't let this monster run loose no matter what!@
` The only way I'm able to resist is by enclosing HIM into rationality's cage....#
` That creaking, fragile cage that could be destroyed at any moment soon...\
` Shut up!@
` Shut up, shut up, shut up!\
` Huhuhu.@
` Hahahahahaha!@
` HAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!\
` Morning!@
` Isn't it morning yet?!@
` Once dawn comes, I'll win.@
` HE will sleep once again, since HE only wakes up at night.@
` When the very first ray of morning sunlight leaks through the gap between the curtains, HE'll go back to sleep once more.\
` And after the sun sets...@ he'll wake up yet again.\
` Morning!@
` How long until morning comes?!\
` Let's drill our nails into a woman's flesh as if it were soft fruit, sip her warm, fresh, crimson blood pounding through her veins, rape her, get her pregnant, and once again preserve our blood for the posterity...\
` Once morning arrives, THIS monster will...!\
` Hey, stop calling me "monster" and "thing".\
` Morning!@
` Morning!@
` Morning!@
` Morning!@ Morning!@
` Morning!@ Morning!@ Morning!@ Morning!@ Morning!@ Morning!@ Morning!@ Morning!@ Morning!@ Morning!@ Morning!@ Morning!@ Morning!@ Morning!@ Morning!@ MORNING!!\
` I'm you, after all.\
` ISN'T IT MORNING YET?!\
` *Fwip!*@
` Vigorously, I leap up from the futon.\
` "Eeek!"@
` When I open my eyelids, the very first thing I perceive in my field of vision is the figure of a woman stiffened out of surprise.@
` She slowly drops her shoulders as her long, black hair flutters along with said motion.\
` This is a room I'm not used to see.@
` Is this the follow-up of the dream?@
` No, that's not it.@ This place is...@
` As the inside of my head becomes gradually clearer, I finally feel myself coming back to reality.@
` This is...@ Yeah, this is my old man's house.@
` I've been having these nightmares for the past three days.\
` The dazzling sunlight flowing from the crack of the opened shoji door makes me narrow my eyes.@
` It's morning.@
` The morning I so badly wished for in my dream, and a refreshing one, on top of that.@
` Besides the blue sky spreading outside, I hear the distant chirps of little birds embellishing this fine day.\
` "P-Please don't scare me like that, Koichi."@
` The woman before me lets out a deep sigh as she places her hand near her chest.@
` "My heart is still pounding hard, you know?"@
` She says smiling awkwardly.@
` In an attempt to hide how embarrassed I am about showing myself half-asleep before her, I crack a bashful smile.@
` "G-Good morning."@
` "Good morning to you too.@ It's a nice day outside."\
` Her name is Chizuru Kashiwagi.@
` She's my 23 years old cousin, 3 years older than me.@
` Last year's spring she graduated from a private university in THAT certain country, but despite her youth, she's the leader of the prestigious Kashiwagi family.@
` She probably came here to wake me up and got surprised when, half-asleep, I jumped up from the futon out of the blue.\
` Her shiny, long black hair reflects the morning sunlight, making it look like it's sparkling.@
` As always, she's a beauty that makes any person open wide their eyes in amazement.@
` Women with gorgeous faces like hers tend to give an impression of "coldness", but curiously, Chizuru doesn't give off those vibes at all.@
` Both her gestures and personality are adorable; she's a very gentle woman, indeed.#
` "What happened that you jumped up so nervously?"@
` Chizuru tilts her head and chuckles as she narrows her eyes.@
