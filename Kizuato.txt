` A dream.\
` I'm having a dream.@
` A dream where I brace myself as I shiver inside a dark room.\
` Confined in this dim, lightless room, I hold my knees while sitting on the cold floor.@ Pearl-like sweatdrops slide along my skin as I attempt desperately to pin down that THING that threatens to crawl out of me.@
` It's THAT kind of dream.\
` Haa, haa...@
` My breath is rough, like that of a carnivorous beast.@
` My whole body shakes as sweat flows down my skin.@
` I'm suffocating.@
` My head hurts so much I feel like it's about to be split apart.@
` Somebody...@ Somebody help me...@
` My lips form the words I want to say, but no sound comes from my throat.@
` Please, anybody...\
` Huhuhu.@
` How long will you keep doing that?\
` A suffocated laughter echoes through my head.\
` It's useless.@
` Futile.@
` Vain.@
` You'll never be able to suppress me.\
` Shut up!@
` I scream.@
` If I lose focus for only a second, HE will break out from that jail called "rationality" and leap out to the real world at once.@
` I dig my fingernails into my knees as I hold them between my arms.@
` I can't afford to lose.\
` Huhuhu, alright.@ You won tonight.@
` But, what will happen tomorrow?@
` And the day after tomorrow?@
` How long will you last without eating, drinking water, or sleeping?@
` It's all the same.@
` All the more when...\
` Shut the fuck up!\
` Huhuhu.@ Be honest; you already noticed it, didn't you?@
` You're fully aware that you've reached your limit.@
` You're fully aware that you can't take it anymore.@
` Come on, release me.@
` Let me free.@
` You're only postponing the inevitable.@
` That's the truth, so why are you suffering in vain?@
` Hm? What do you say?\
` No.
` No, no, no!
` I can't let this monster run loose no matter what!@
` The only way I'm able to resist is by enclosing HIM into rationality's cage....#
` That creaking, fragile cage that could be destroyed at any moment soon...\
` Shut up!@
` Shut up, shut up, shut up!\
` Huhuhu.@
` Hahahahahaha!@
` HAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!\
` Morning!@
` Isn't it morning yet?!@
` Once dawn comes, I'll win.@
` HE will sleep once again, since HE only wakes up at night.@
` When the very first ray of morning sunlight leaks through the gap between the curtains, HE'll go back to sleep once more.\
` And after the sun sets...@ he'll wake up yet again.\
` Morning!@
` How long until morning comes?!\
` Let's drill our nails into a woman's flesh as if it were soft fruit, sip her warm, fresh, crimson blood pounding through her veins, rape her, get her pregnant, and once again preserve our blood for the posterity...\
` Once morning arrives, THIS monster will...!\
` Hey, stop calling me "monster" and "thing".\
` Morning!@
` Morning!@
` Morning!@
` Morning!@ Morning!@
` Morning!@ Morning!@ Morning!@ Morning!@ Morning!@ Morning!@ Morning!@ Morning!@ Morning!@ Morning!@ Morning!@ Morning!@ Morning!@ Morning!@ Morning!@ MORNING!!\
` I'm you, after all.\
` ISN'T IT MORNING YET?!\
` *Fwip!*@
` Vigorously, I leap up from the futon.\
` "Eeek!"@
` When I open my eyelids, the very first thing I perceive in my field of vision is the figure of a woman stiffened out of surprise.@
` She slowly drops her shoulders as her long, black hair flutters along with said motion.\
` This is a room I'm not used to see.@
` Is this the follow-up of the dream?@
` No, that's not it.@ This place is...@
` As the inside of my head becomes gradually clearer, I finally feel myself coming back to reality.@
` This is...@ Yeah, this is my old man's house.@
` I've been having these nightmares for the past three days.\
` The dazzling sunlight flowing from the crack of the opened shoji door makes me narrow my eyes.@
` It's morning.@
` The morning I so badly wished for in my dream, and a refreshing one, on top of that.@
` Besides the blue sky spreading outside, I hear the distant chirps of little birds embellishing this fine day.\
` "P-Please don't scare me like that, Koichi."@
` The woman before me lets out a deep sigh as she places her hand near her chest.@
` "My heart is still pounding hard, you know?"@
` She says smiling awkwardly.@
` In an attempt to hide how embarrassed I am about showing myself half-asleep before her, I crack a bashful smile.@
` "G-Good morning."@
` "Good morning to you too.@ It's a nice day outside."\
` Her name is Chizuru Kashiwagi.@
` She's my 23 years old cousin, 3 years older than me.@
` Last year's spring she graduated from a private university in THAT certain country, but despite her youth, she's the leader of the prestigious Kashiwagi family.@
` She probably came here to wake me up and got surprised when, half-asleep, I jumped up from the futon out of the blue.\
` Her shiny, long black hair reflects the morning sunlight, making it look like it's sparkling.@
` As always, she's a beauty that makes any person open wide their eyes in amazement.@
` Women with gorgeous faces like hers tend to give an impression of "coldness", but curiously, Chizuru doesn't give off those vibes at all.@
` Both her gestures and personality are adorable; she's a very gentle woman, indeed.#
` "What happened that you jumped up so nervously?"@
` Chizuru tilts her head and chuckles as she narrows her eyes.@
` "N-Nothing..."@
` I drop my head and answer shyly while rubbing my sleepy eyes.\
` "Did you have a nightmare?"@
` Her affectionate voice gives me a "motherly" impression of her; someone you'd want to spoil you without even realizing why.@
` A tender tone very befitting of the kind of person she is.@
` "Y-Yes, sort of."@
` I lift my face as I hold down my bed hair.@
` These weird dreams have been pestering me since two, three days ago.\
` Yeah, this is actually the third time I had this dream counting yesterday and two days ago.@
` Also, this is the first time in my life I dream the same thing three days in a row.@
` No, to be precise, they aren't EXACTLY the same dream.@
` They become more serious and significant with each day passing,@
` and the presence of that "monster" inside my mind becomes stronger and sharper as days pass by, too.\
` He'll probably take the lead of my consciousness the next time around.@
` And when that happens...@ After my consciousness gets absorbed by him in that virtual reality we call "dreams", what will happen with me...?\
` Just kidding.@
` We're talking about mere dreams, after all.@
` I don't think anything serious will occur.@
` Dreams are just that; dreams.@ They're not real.@
` However, I've heard a lot that dreams are like the mirror of one's soul that reflects one's subconscious self.@
` That means that monster is the materialization of my true nature, which in turn means that, deep inside my mind, I crave those kind of pleasures...\
` "Koichi."@
` "Whoa!"@
` I lift my face and meet Chizuru's large eyes.@
` Seeing me so surprised, she cracks a giggle.@
` "What kind of "weird dream" was it?"@
` Chizuru asks me, perhaps worried about me being overcome by emotions.@
` "Huh?@ How was it?"\
` "Yes.@ I may not look like it, but I've actually studied psychology a bit.@ Would you like me to analyze this strange dream you had, Koichi?"@
` Chizuru smiles mischievously.@
` This innocent, childish side of hers is partly why she appears to be so lovely...@ or at least that's what I think.\
` So she wants to know what the dream was about, huh?@
` That eerie mental picture reappears in the back of my mind.@
` It was so ominous I don't think she'll give me a positive reading in the slightest.@
` She'll probably just conclude I have unsatisfied desires, wishes I want to fulfill and whatnot.@
` That said, after hearing her soft-hearted voice, I can't help but feel compelled to tell her everything in detail.\
` Resigning myself, I'll...
` 1. Tell her everything about the dream.
` 2. Joking that she appeared in the dream.
` 3. Laugh it off.
` "Actually, you appeared in my dream..."@
` I mutter, still dropping my gaze to the futon.@
` "Huh?@ Me?"@
` She makes a puzzled face.@
` "Yeah, it was really scary."@
` After a brief pause, Chizuru finally understands what I want to say.\
` "Koichi!@ Was that dream about me so scary that you jumped out of bed?!"@
` She glares at me.@
` "I-I was just kidding."@
` "S-Sheeesh, you're so mean!"@
` Chizuru pouts and turns away.@
` Uuh, b-but...!@
` Even her gestures of anger are adorable!@ That's unfair!\
` "Sometimes you can be really rude with words, Koichi!"@
` "C'mon, Chizuru!@ It was only a joke!"@
` She crosses her arms and sighs in exasperation.@
` "I'm so sorry...!@ I was just pulling your leg, I swear!"@
` "No, I get what you mean!@ I scare you so much I even appear in your dreams, isn't that right?!"@
` "Of course not!@ First off, any dream you appear in could just NEVER be a nightmare!"\
` Then, she chuckles and turns around.@
` "What... do you mean by that?"
` She moves her face close to mine.@
` "N-No, it's just..."@
` Seeing me babble in confusion, Chizuru lets out a giggle.\
` "Geez.@ If you're going to apologize, then don't say it in the first place."@
` She pokes my forehead with her index finger.@
` At that moment, my heart skips a beat, and after a slight delay, my cheeks acquire a feverish color.\
` "Huhu.@ You're just like a grown-up kid, Koichi.@ Oh, you have some bed-hair here."@
` With her slender fingers, Chizuru holds down a lock of my hair standing out.@
` Quite a thing to say for someone as immature as her...@
` I chew my own words.\
` I first met her when I was 11 years old, in my summer holidays of 5th grade.@
` She was 14 years old back then, and attended 2nd year of middle school.@
` Since I was going through puberty, she was totally like a big sister to me.\
` Being as kind as she is now, she called me "Koi" as if I were her real little brother, and of course, I became attached to her since she was so charming and gentle.@
` The reason why she treats me like a child is because the image she had of me back in those days of old has been ingrained in her since then.\
` Without even realizing when, I surpassed her in height and she started calling me by my name, "Koichi".@
` However, my relationship with her hasn't essentially changed since those days.@
` For Chizuru, I'm still the same 5th grader she met on those summer holidays.\
` But still...@ I know I'm being repetitive here, but I really think Chizuru is beautiful.@
` I find hard to believe that we share even a quarter of the same blood.@
` Opening my eyelids and seeing her before me like this, as well as hearing her tenderhearted voice, is enough reason to look forward waking up every morning.@
` Indulging myself in such egoistical delusions, I'm about to leave the futon, but then...@
` "!"@
` I notice something VERY IMPORTANT, and awkwardly stop on my tracks.\
` Now that I remember, it's morning.@
` This is the time men become unconditionally "lively".@
` Yeah, I'm not in a "state" where I can show myself to Chizuru at all.
` At this point I have no reason to be ashamed of walking around wearing only a T-shirt and shorts, but that THING inside my shorts is another matter entirely.\
` If Chizuru saw my lively buddy like this...@
` S-Shit!@ The more aware I become of it, the worse it gets!@
` And the worst part is that I have the urge to pee.@
` Daaamn!@ That said, exposing my lively boner before her is out of the question...@ Ah, fuck it.@ I'll stay here inside the futon until Chizuru leaves the room.\
` "Is something the matter?"@
` Chizuru asks.@
` "You look somewhat distressed..."@
` It seems that, without even realizing it, I'm making a serious face.@
` "N-No, umm..."@
` "Are you worried about the dream?"@
` No, I don't care about that anymore...@
` "Uh, no, not really..."@
` I answer without really meaning it.\
` "K-Koichi..."@
` Chizuru opens wide her eyes.@
` "Huh?!"@
` W-What is it?!@
` D-Did she find out?!@
` Rushedly, I hold down my crotch hidden inside the futon.@
` That "monster" pressed down there swells enraged as if rebelling against its master.\
` "U-Umm..."@
` Waaah!@ Don't say it, please!@
` My ears turn red of embarrassment.@
` Nonetheless, Chizuru's response is nothing but unexpected.@
` "I'm sorry, Koichi."\
` I look at her baffled.@
` "I'm talking about the dream.@ You look so terribly worried about that and yet I was making fun of it..."@
` Huh?@ W-What?@
` "No, that's not... the problem..."\
` "I thought about your dad as my own father.@ That's why you're like a real little brother to me."@
` She whispers hanging her head.@
` "Well, I think you've been doing a good job about..."@
` "No, I wanted our relationship to be more understanding and family-like than before, but by behaving like this I failed as a big sister.@ My little brother is in trouble and all I do is poking fun at him..."\
` H-Hey, hold up.@
` Isn't this conversation taking a radical turnabout?@
` My urge to pee is reaching the limit of my endurance, and Chizuru's speech seems like it's going to turn more heated from now onwards.@
` It looks like she got the wrong idea about this, so I should clear this misunderstanding as soon as possible.@
` No, she's genuinely worried about me, so that'd be rude to her.@
` Hmm...\
` Given this predicament, I'll...
` 1. Endure a bit more and listen to what Chizuru has to say.
` 2. Tell her that I need to go to the john.
` I'm hesitant about cutting her short when she's so worried about me, but my bladder needs to relieve itself too.@
` I'm about to hit the limit of my endurance, too.@
` "Perhaps the cause of your nightmares is that you're not accustomed to sleeping in this room?"@
` Chizuru's thinking about the dream seriously.@
` "I have trouble falling asleep when I don't have my own pillow, and since I can't quite relax that way, I end up having nightmares."@
` "Um, listen, Chizuru..."@
` Out of the blue, I cut to the chase.\
` "Yes?"@
` I stop Chizuru's speech and lift my head.@
` "Let's talk about the dream later.@ I'm not even concerned about it."@
` I take the chance to clarify that confusion.@
` "Is that so?@ It's just you looked pretty tormented about it."@
` "W-Well, that's because..."@
` "?"\
` "Um, I-I want to go to the toilet..."@
` "Oh."
` Chizuru mutters in a low voice as she blushes a little.@
` Perhaps opening up about it made me relaxed, because the moment I told her about it my urge subsided.@
` Kgh...@ I think...@ I can't take it anymore!@
