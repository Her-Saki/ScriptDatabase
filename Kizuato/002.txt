` "N-Nothing..."@
` I drop my head and answer shyly while rubbing my sleepy eyes.\
` "Did you have a nightmare?"@
` Her affectionate voice gives me a "motherly" impression of her; someone you'd want to spoil you without even realizing why.@
` A tender tone very befitting of the kind of person she is.@
` "Y-Yes, sort of."@
` I lift my face as I hold down my bed hair.@
` These weird dreams have been pestering me since two, three days ago.\
` Yeah, this is actually the third time I had this dream counting yesterday and two days ago.@
` Also, this is the first time in my life I dream the same thing three days in a row.@
` No, to be precise, they aren't EXACTLY the same dream.@
` They become more serious and significant with each day passing,@
` and the presence of that "monster" inside my mind becomes stronger and sharper as days pass by, too.\
` He'll probably take the lead of my consciousness the next time around.@
` And when that happens...@ After my consciousness gets absorbed by him in that virtual reality we call "dreams", what will happen with me...?\
` Just kidding.@
` We're talking about mere dreams, after all.@
` I don't think anything serious will occur.@
` Dreams are just that; dreams.@ They're not real.@
` However, I've heard a lot that dreams are like the mirror of one's soul that reflects one's subconscious self.@
` That means that monster is the materialization of my true nature, which in turn means that, deep inside my mind, I crave those kind of pleasures...\
` "Koichi."@
` "Uah!"@
` I lift my face and meet Chizuru's large eyes.@
` Seeing me so surprised, she cracks a giggle.@
` "What kind of "weird dream" was it?"@
` Chizuru asks me, perhaps worried about me being overcome by emotions.@
` "Huh?@ How was it?"\
` "Yes.@ I may not look like it, but I've actually studied psychology a bit.@ Would you like me to analyze this strange dream you had, Koichi?"@
` Chizuru smiles mischievously.@
` This innocent, chidish side of hers is partly why she appears to be so lovely...@ or at least that's what I think.\
` So she wants to know what the dream was about, huh?@
` That eerie mental picture reappears in the back of my mind.@
` It was so ominous I don't think she'll give me a positive reading in the slightest.@
` She'll probably just conclude I have unsatisfied desires, wishes I want to fulfill and whatnot.@
` That said, after hearing her soft-hearted voice, I can't help but feel compelled to tell her everything in detail.\
` Resigning myself, I'll...
` 1. Tell her everything about the dream.
` 2. Joking that she appeared in the dream.
` 3. Laugh it off.
` "Actually, you appeared in my dream..."@
` I mutter, still dropping my gaze to the futon.@
` "Huh?@ Me?"@
` She makes a puzzled face.@
` "Yeah, it was really scary."@
` After a brief pause, Chizuru finally understands what I want to say.\
` "Koichi!@ Was that dream about me so scary that you jumped out of bed?!"@
` She glares at me.@
` "I-I was just kidding."@
` "S-Sheeesh, you're so mean!"@
` Chizuru pouts and turns away.@
` Uuh, b-but...!@
` Even her gestures of anger are adorable!@ That's unfair!\
` "Sometimes you can be really rude with words, Koichi!"@
` "C'mon, Chizuru!@ It was only a joke!"@
` She crosses her arms and sighs in exasperation.@
` "I'm so sorry...!@ I was just pulling your leg, I swear!"@
` "No, I get what you mean!@ I'm scare you so much I even appear in your dreams, isn't that right?!"@
` "Of course not!@ First off, any dream you appear in could just NEVER be a nightmare!"\
` Then, she chuckles and turns around.@
` "What... do you mean by that?"
` She moves her face close to mine.@
` "N-No, it's just..."@
` Seeing me babble in confusion, Chizuru lets out a giggle.\
` "Geez.@ If you're going to apologize, then don't say it in the first place."@
` She pokes my forehead with her index finger.@
` At that moment, my heart skips a beat, and after a slight delay, my cheeks acquire a feverish color.\
` "Huhu.@ You're just like a grown-up kid, Koichi.@ Oh, you have some bed-hair here."@
` With her slender fingers, Chizuru holds down a lock of my hair standing out.@
` Quite a thing to say for someone as immature as her...@
` I chew my own words.\
` I first met her, my cousin, when I was 11 years old, in my summer holidays of 5th grade.@
` She was 14 years old back then, and attended 2nd year of middle school.@
` Since I was going through puberty, she was totally like a big sister to me.\
` Being as kind as she is now, she called me "Koi" as if I were his real little brother, and of course, I became attached to her since she was so charming and gentle.@
` The reason why she treats me like a child is because the image she had of me back in those days of old has been ingrained in her since then.\
` Without even realizing when, I surpassed her in height and she started calling me by my name, "Koichi".@
` However, my relationship with her hasn't essentially changed since those days.@
` For Chizuru, I'm still the same 5th grader she met on those summer holidays.\
` But still...@ I know I'm being repetitive here, but I really think Chizuru is beautiful.@
` I find hard to believe that we share even a quarter of the same blood.@
` Opening my eyelids and seeing her before me like this, as well as hearing her tenderhearted voice, is enough reason to look forward waking up every morning.@
` Indulging myself in such egoistical delusions, I'm about to leave the futon, but then...@
` "!"@
` I notice something VERY IMPORTANT, and awkwardly stop on my tracks.\
` Now that I remember, it's morning.@
` This is the time men become unconditionally "lively".@
` Yeah, I'm not in a "state" where I can show myself to Chizuru at all.
` At this point I have no reason to be ashamed of walking around wearing only a T-shirt and shorts, but that THING inside my shorts is another matter entirely.\
` If Chizuru saw my lively buddy like this...@
` S-Shit!@ The more aware I become of it, the worse it gets!@
` And the worst part is that I have the urge to pee.@
` Daaamn!@ That said, exposing my lively boner before her is out of the question...@ Ah, fuck it.@ I'll stay here inside the futon until Chizuru leaves the room.\
` "Is something the matter?"@
` Chizuru asks.@
` "You look somewhat distressed..."@
` It seems that, without even realizing it, I'm making a serious face.@
` "N-No, umm..."@
` "Are you worried about the dream?"@
` No, I don't care about that anymore...@
