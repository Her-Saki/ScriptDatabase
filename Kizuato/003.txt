"Actually, you appeared in my dream..."@, I mutter, still staring down to the futon.@«
<CHGCHAR><$01><$08>
"--What?@ Me?"@«
She makes a puzzled face.@«
"Yeah, it was really scary."@«
After a brief pause, Chizuru finally understands what I want to say.#
<CHGCHAR><$01><$05>\

"--Koichi!@ Was that dream about me so scary that you jumped out of bed?!"@«
She glares at me.@«
"I-I was just kidding."@«
<CHGCHAR><$01><$0E>
"S-Sheeesh, you're so mean!"@«
Chizuru pouts and turns the other way.@«
Ugh, b-but...!@«
Even her gestures of anger are adorable!@ She's so sneaky!#\

"Sometimes you can be really rude with words, Koichi!"@«
"C'mon, Chizuru!@ It was only a joke!"@«
She crosses her arms and lets out an exasperated sigh.@«
"I'm so sorry...!@ I was just pulling your leg, I swear!"@«
"No, you made yourself very clear!@ I scare you so much that I even appear in your dreams, isn't that right?!"@
"Of course not!@ First off, any dream you appear in could just NEVER be a nightmare!"#
<CHGCHAR><$01><$08>\

Then, Chizuru chuckles and turns around to me.@«
"What... do you mean by that?"@«
She moves her face close to mine.@«
"N-No, it's just..."@«
Seeing me babble in confusion, she cracks a giggle.#\

"Geez.@ If you're going to apologize later just don't say it in the first place."@«
She pokes my forehead with her index finger.@«
At that instant my heart skips a beat, and after a slight delay my cheeks grow hotter.#\

"Huhu.@ You're really just like a grown-up kid, Koichi.@ Oh, you have some bed-hair here."@«
Using her slender fingers, Chizuru holds down a lock of my hair standing out.@«
I feel like a child when an adult strokes their hair, and become even more embarrassed.@«
She surely talks a lot for someone as immature as her...@«
I chew my own words.#\

I first met this older cousin of mine when I was 11 years old, during my summer holidays of 5th grade.@«
She was 14 years old back then, and attended 2nd year of middle school.@«
I was going through puberty back then, so she was totally like a big sister to me.#\

Since she was as kind as she is now, she called me "Koi" with affection as if I were her real little brother.@«
Of course, she was so charming and gentle that I became very fond of her too.@«
I think the reason why she treats me like a kid is because the impression she had of me back then solidified forever inside her.#\

Without even realizing it, I surpassed her in height and she started calling me by my name, "Koichi".@
However, my relationship with her hasn't really changed since those days of old.@
For Chizuru, I'm still the same 5th grader she met on those summer holidays.#
