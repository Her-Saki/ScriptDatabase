"N-No, um...@ Hah, hahaha..."@«
I laugh to evade her question.@«
I can't for the life of me tell her about that dream.@
I wouldn't mind having her analyze it if it was more abstract, but this one was particularly literal, with no room for interpretation.@«
I don't want to affix a cone of shame to myself.@«
It'd be like declaring THOSE are my true colors.#\

"Don't worry about it.@ It's just a meaningless dream, and I almost forgot most of it."@«
I lie while rubbing my still sleepy eyes with the back of my hand.@«
For some reason, even if it's only a trifle, lying to her feels painful.@«
<CHGCHAR><$01><$B2>
"--I see."@«
Chizuru's face becomes slightly relaxed.#
<CHGCHAR><$01><$08>\

"Someone once said dreams are the path towards the realm of the subconscious".@«
"I heard that quote before too.@ I think it was from a psychology college lecturer...@ Freud?@ Or perhaps Jung?"@«
"Bingo.@ It's a quote of Sigmund Freud"@«
Under the morning sunlight coming from the window, Chizuru giggles cheerfully.#\

"Human brain divides its functions across several lobes, and while we sleep, its activities turn off in a scattered manner.@ For example..."@«
She presses her index finger against the right side of my head.@«
<CHGCHAR><$01><$0F>
"When only the memory lobe is active, you dream about the past..."@«
Now her finger slides a bit upwards.@«
It feels just a tiny bit nice.@«
"And when only the lobe that controls the sight is on, you imagine isolated, contextless scenes in your mind."#\

While normally Chizuru tends to daydream, now her eyes give off a sort of intellectual aura.@«
Perhaps the gap between our academic backgrounds is the cause, but despite she's only three years older than me, she looks totally like a superior student to me.@«
<CHGCHAR><$01><$08>
"When the lobe that controls social behavior is asleep and the lobe that manages emotions and desires is up, our true instincts that are normally ignored at a subconscious level thanks to the reason appear in the form of dreams.@ They are indeed the path towards subconscious."#\

"Does that mean dangerous dreams are the true nature of humans when the shackles of reason are loose?"@«
"They symbolize such instincts, yes."@«
Oof, that was close.@«
Thank goodness I didn't tell her about my dream.@
If I heard directly from Chizuru that those weird inclinations are my real self, I'd never recover emotionally from it.#\

"In that case, isn't it kind of embarrasing to speak with other people about your dreams?"@«
<CHGCHAR><$01><$B2>
"Well, it's just like telling others about your real self in a roundabout way.@ That said, when you talk with others about your dreams all you're exposing is usually just a harmless dramatization."@«
"But the embarrasing details are still there..."@«
"Depending on the person, some people will be able to tell."#\

I have just realized something...@«
"Huh?@ Then, when you were asking me about my dream..."@«
<CHGCHAR><$01><$B3>
"Oops, my bad."@«
Chizuru sticks out her tongue.@«
It's a quirk of hers that doesn't match her beauty.@«
That said, that childish habit that could be even considered vulgar looks extremely cute in her.#\

"What's your problem, Chizuru?!@ You were tricking me with leading questions!"@«
<CHGCHAR><$01><$0C>
"N-No, umm...@ I just thought I'd hear your troubles, you know, as any good older cousin would do..."@«
Chizuru musters a clumsy smile.@«
"Mind your own business!@ If you want to hear about mine, tell me about YOUR dreams first."#\

"U-Ummm...@ I've been sleeping like a log lately, so I don't usually remember them..."@«
"That's unfair.@ Okay, forget it.@ I got it already.@ I know now what kind of person you are."@«
"I'm telling you the truth!"@«
<CHGCHAR><$01><$B2>
Of course, I'm not really angry.@«
I'm just having fun bullying her like this.#
