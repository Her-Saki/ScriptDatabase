` "...!"@
` Spreading her immaculate wings as her long hair becomes more and more disarranged with each wild swing, the angel lets out a suffocated scream, while the monster, with its demonic eye wide open, sways violently its lenghty tentacles and gives a roar akin to the rumbling of an earthquake.\
` Angels are strange creatures.@
` They're beautiful, and that's precisely why they evoke the latent wickedness hidden in the heart of whoever observes them.@
` But if such is the case, can they still be considered "sacred" beings?\
` "...!"@
` The beast, which might as well be called the incarnation of depravity, crawls across the angel's body as if licking it entirely.@
` Restrained by a wave of meaty limbs, the angel is unable to resist them as they penetrate her insides.@
` Creeping like worms, those slimy embodiments of biological hatred rape the angel; the monster's sexual fluids taint her skin and seep into it.\
` "...!"@
` Erosion...
` "...!"@
` Assimilation...
` "...!"@
` Yeah, it'd be most appropriate to call this act "assimilation".\
` The beast looks similar to SOMETHING, but I can't pinpoint exactly what it is.\
` No, in fact...@ it's similar to SOMEONE.\
` Very similar, indeed.@
` But to who, exactly?\
` From the lower part of the beast, tentacles slither covering my field of vision as if a crimson rug was spread before me.@
` The monster turns around to me and opens wide its mouth.@
` A mucous-textured oral cavity...@ which resembles a bottomless abyss.@
` As I'm eaten by HIM, the personification of absolute negativity, I'm assaulted by an odd sensation...\
` Fear and relief.@
` Hatred and affection.@
` Inscrutability and understanding.@
` Pollution and purity.@
` Love and hate.@
` Light and darkness.@
` Several contradictory feelings form a torrent and flow inside me...\
` The face of that monster...\
` The face of that angel...\
` My own face...\
` "A nightmare?"@
` The woman wearing a white coat stares fixedly at me.@
` She's Tonae Ohmori, the person I came to see in this room hazy with purple smoke.@
` Outside, the dusk has engulfed everything; in the courtyard I can see from the window, shadows of trees extend a long way, while the orange-shaded light that leaks inside the room dyes Tonae's face amber.\
` "Well, it's no big deal, isn't it?@ That means you're sleeping like a log as you should."@
` "I know, but still..."@
` The sour smell of medicine...@ Our conversations that tend to stagnate more than often...@
` In this room where she's the boss, we puff at cigarettes together.@
` The beds covered by cheap vinyl...@
` The thin curtains that divide them...@
` The dull, silver light reflecting off medical tools...@
` This room, whose atmosphere is completely different from any other, never fails to make me feel a little nervous.@
` Aside from the purple smoke spiraling up to the ceiling, everything inside is motionless.@
` Along with a numbing sensation inside my head,@
` time itself stops its course completely.\
` "A nightmare, huh?@ Care to describe it?"@
` When Tonae draws my attention, I become free from that binding spell and time flows once again.@
` "......"@
` I gaze absent-mindedly at her face without answering immediately.@
` Her pouty lips...@ Her languid, sleepy eyes...@
` And her body whose mature voluptuousness is visible even from outside her white coat.@
` That's not exactly the reason, but I...@ have a hard time dealing with her.\
` Part of the reason I come to this room is because it's one of the few places where I can smoke, but aside from that...@ I think I just want to conversate with her.@
` Since I'm bad at communicating with people, the fact that she always breaks the ice first is a godsend.@
` That's why I frequent this place regularly, but sometimes, as we talk, my awkwardness in regards to her rears its ugly head.@
` It's like a "vicious cycle" of sorts.\
` During the day, countless people come and go from the infirmary.@
` It seems she's well-beloved in the school and everybody counts on her.@
` That's all the more reason I don't find very pleasant to show myself here.@
` It'd be unbearable for me if people thought wrongly that I've fallen for her or that I'm emotionally dependant on her.@
` I think her feminine sexual appeal only makes it easier for those kind of misunderstandings to pop up.@
` But... is it really a misunderstanding?@ What part of all that is actually correct and what isn't?@
` It's a real problem, but I always come back here anyway.\
` Since I came to this school, I've presented myself in her place almost every day when the sun starts sinking in the horizon.\
` She furrows her brows as she gulps in a puff of smoke, exhales slowly, and repeats her question.@
` "So?@ How was it?"@
` "W-Well, the monster..."@
` "There was a monster?"@
` "Yeah..."@
` "It was scary, wasn't it?"@
` "You bet.@ It was creepy as hell...@ I felt like I was going to be swallowed by it."@
` "I see, but...@ it was only a dream, right?@ Is it really something to be concerned about?"@
` "Y-Yeah, I guess you're right..."@
` "A monster, huh?@ Tell me, have you been feeling tired lately?"@
` That's right, I'm exhausted.@ Exhausted about this "teaching practice" I'm engaging in now.\
` "Man, you're too serious for your own good.@ Are you really that worried?"@
` "Huh?@ Are you talking about the teaching practice?"@
` "Nh?@ Teaching practice?"@
` "......"
` "Nah, forget about what I said.@ I get the picture now."@
` "Ah, did you mean the dream?"@
` "Well, it doesn't matter which, really.@ The fact remains that you're racking your brains over it."@
` "Can you make something out of what I told you about the dream?"@
` "I'm afraid not.@ I'm not Jung nor Freud, y'know?"\
` I think she's being rude laughing off my problems like this.@
` However, that's just how she usually is.@
` I drop my gaze down to the hem of her white coat, and hit her with the most spiteful remark I'm able to tell.@
` "You're right.@ You hardly look like a bearded old man."@
` "Hmm..."@
` Tonae stubs out the crop of her cigarette in the ashtray.@
` With a sidelong glance, I see her smile ever so faintly.@
` "I see...@ So you're having trouble with teaching practice, huh?"@
` Perhaps I'm just being paranoid, but the way she talks makes me feel like she's interrogating me.@
` I don't know how to reply, or rather, I can't connect words naturally in my head.@
` I feel like I must by no means say something wrong here.@ A pretty nonsensical obsession to be trapped in.\
` "So...@ Umm...@ You see..."@
` I look desperately for an answer, but as I'm about to speak, a couple of dry knocks at the door interrupt me.\
` "Excuse me..."@
` With a bit of difficulty given how much it weighs, a girl opens the creaky sliding door and enters the room.@
` If she's visiting this room, it's likely she falls into one of the following categories: she's sick, she has some kind of business with Tonae...@ or she came to lit up a cig like me.@
` Facing slightly downwards, she unhurriedly steps inside and closes the door.@
` I avert my gaze from her in order to feign indifference, and light another cigarette.\
` "U-Umm...@ Ms. Ohmori..."@
` Her voice sounds listless, lethargic.@ Is she not feeling well?@
` At the very least I can tell she's not here to smoke.@
` "Hm?@ What is it?"@
` However, I feel that describing her behavior as "typical of a sick person" is kind of a superfluous remark.@
` She stands right next to me fidgeting restlessly.@
` The strands of her hair flutter before my eyes, but for an instant, that long hair traversing my sight blows against the wind.@
` "Ah..."@
` Along with a short-lived cry, her slender body gives a slight lurch, and I catch her by reflex.\
` I make eye contact with the girl looking at me surprised while I hold her in my arms.@
` As I gaze at her face, I can see my own face reflected in her eyes.@
` I wonder if she sees herself reflected in mine as well.@
` During this enigmatic double-mirror experience,@
` the clock freezes once more.\
` "Hey, are you okay?"@
` And the one who puts it back in motion is, naturally, Tonae.@
` "Y-Yes, I'm sorry..."@
` Tonae approaches me without hesitation, grabs the girl who is still in my arms from the shoulders, takes her up to one of the beds and makes her sit there.@
` I feel like she snatched her from me.\
` The touch of her delicate body lingers in my arms.@
` The feather-like, ethereal weight of a young girl...@
` Her slim fingers grabbing my clothes...@
` The neat scent of her hair filling my nasal cavities...@
` Bittersweet adolescence in all its splendour.@
` Nonetheless, I don't really think I need to describe all that about her.\
` "Your name?"@
` "Mutsuki...@ Mutsuki Sugamo."@
` "Oh, I see...@ This is the first time you come here, isn't it?"@
` "Yes."@
` I overhear their conversation beyond the divider panel...@
` and feel the presence of the girl as she lies in the bed.@
` Suddenly, I feel like I shouldn't stay in this room anymore.\
` I push my cigarette against the ashtray full of tobacco ashes and, without even making sure if I actually put out the fire, I stand up with a rushed motion.@
` At any rate, I think I should get out of this room now.\
` "W-Well, if you'll excuse me..."@
` I don't know if they heard me back there, but I leave the room without waiting for their answer.\
` Unable to pull myself together, I return to the (obviously temporary) seat the school alotted for me in the staff room, and start writing paperwork as I sniff the aroma of the tea I made for myself.@
` As per school policy, every day I must write these documents...@ or perhaps I should call it journal, and submit a piece of it.@
` As I compose sentence after sentence with my pencil, I become bewildered at how poor my vocabulary is.@
` My lack of writing abilty and this line of work where I myself give form to the embodiment of my own insignificance makes me feel blue.\
` "How's it going?"@
` This woman that calls out to me while I struggle with the journal is Semina Takashima.\
` We're not far apart in age, but unlike me, she's a full-fledged, formal teacher.@ In other words, she's in charge of my education.@
` Short-haired and tall, she supervises the athletics club every day, which explains her graceful figure and upright spine.@
` However, if you ask me, I think the cold gleam dwelling in her almond eyes kills the healthy impression her lively body gives.@
` In addition, her wide forehead and thin, harsh lips make her stand out as an intellectual-type ice queen.\
` "You don't need to think too hard about it.@ Just write whatever is in your head now or something that happened to you today."@
` "Y-Yes..."@
` She turns back her gaze to her own work, and without adding anything else, she falls silent.@
` Feeling a bit bitter towards myself for the stupid reply I did, I go back to my endless journal-writing challenge.\
` I wonder how many times I wrote this journal since I came to this school...@
` Wait, how long has it been since I came...?@
` It's not like I keep an exact count of the days, but I don't think it was a very long time.@
` That said, I have a feeling that I've been working on this journal since forever...@
` Usually, I bring every day to a close writing in this journal,@
` but today, for some reason, I'm doing even less progress than normal.\
` "Fuh..."@
` I decide to finish today's entry here.@
` This journal is not a part of my duties.@
` I have to write whatever I'm able to and submit the journal to her desk.@ That's all they ask me to do.\
` As always, Semina moves her left hand busily across the paperwork.@
` The light of the setting sun coming from the window illuminates her whole body with an orange tone.\
` "Are you done with it?"@
` Perhaps realizing I was observing her in silence, she turns her gaze to me once more.@
` Her attitude is that of an adult that feels obliged to talk to a kid who's nervously jiggling next to them.@
` "Y-Yes, here it is."\
` She takes my journal in silence and quickly looks it over.@
` I feel a mute pressure coming from her, but that's probably just my imagination.@
` Rather, this attitude of hers is nothing more than one of her "quirks"; in her eyes, this is merely a fixed ritual that takes place every day after I finish my shift.@
` The usual silence extends for a while...@ until eventually she lifts up her face.\
` "Alright, good job".@
` The journals are collected once per week and presented as formal reports to the upper echelon of the school.@
` After paperwork is done, I'm basically free to walk around the school all I want.@
` What should I do...?@
` For now, I'll go to the bathroom to think something out.\
` "Oh?@ Where are you going?"@
` "Uh, it's just..."@
` I point to the entrance of the room.@
` She slowly turns her head in the direction I pointed, gives a slight nod, lifts the pen she holds in her left hand and starts flapping it.\
` "I see...@ Okay, see you tomorrow."@
` "Yes, thank you."@
` Taking the reflected light of the sundown, Semina's face is tinted burning red.@
` However, that doesn't diminish the cold feeling of her facial features in the slightest...@
` "Thank you for your hard work."@
` "My pleasure..."@
` I slide quietly the white door and leave for the hallway.\
` *Thud*\
` I answer the call of nature as I stare at the pure-white toilet bowl.@
` I find somewhat pleasant spending time in the toilet stall.@
` It's a space where I can be alone, and being locked up in its small frame feels comfortable.\
` Alright, where I could go now?@
` I might as well roam aimlessly along the extensive grounds of the school...@
` or go to see Tonae again in the infirmary.@
` Having a smoke in the rooftop sounds like a good idea, too.\
` *Thud*\
` I leave the toilet behind.\
` Okay, where should I go next?@
` I'll show myself at the infirmary once more.@
` I came up all the way to the door, but I'm hesitant about opening it.@
` What reason do I have to be here again?@
` Basically, I have trouble dealing with Tonae's cheerful and frank personality... and yet I'm here.
` Why...?@
` I guess it's just that, after talking with her, I always feel strangely relieved.@
` Finally, I open door as if some force pulled me inside.\
` *Slide*\
` "Hello..."@
` "The clinic's closed for today, pal!"@
` She says without even turning around, waving her right hand as if shooing me away.\
` "Oh, it's you."@
` "Good afternoon."@
` "If you have no business here, go home!@ Just kidding, at this point I don't feel like warning you anymore."@
` The doc says as she sips tea and eats cookies nonchalantly.\
` "Wanna some tea?"@
` "Oh, thank you very much."@
` As usual, the pile of cigarette butts filling the ashtray on the table form a miniature Mt. Tsurugi.@
` The ventilation fans on top of the windows thrown open spin and spin.@
` I think having them just above the windows kinda defeats their purpose...@
` Then, throwing a glance at me as I look over the room restlessly, she starts speaking.\
` "What's wrong?"@
` "Oh, it's just I haven't been in a infirmary since high school..."@
` "Hmm...@ Do you find this room strange?"@
` "Yeah, a bit..."\
` White walls...@ White curtains...@ White divider panels...@
` Wall posters about eyeball anatomy and skin diseases everywhere...@
` A scale so big it makes me wonder if a human being can really weigh that much...@
` The mixed stench of hydrogen peroxide with tincture of iodine...@
` An anatomy model that seems like it could start moving any second...@
` Nh?@ An anatomy model?\
` "Why do you have this here?"@
` I ask Tonae who is standing by the sink preparing the tea.@
` Handing me a teacup so rustic it looks like something they'd give you in a sushi restaurant, she answers:\
` "Nh?@ Oh, that?@ It's just a hobby of mine ☆"@
` "A hobby...?"@
` My goodness, she's ODD.@
` I have no idea how to reply to that, so I take out a cigarette from my pocket and light it.@
` Then, as I put my lighter back in my pocket, I ask Tonae who holds a cig in her mouth:@
` "This has been bugging me for a while, but..."@
` "Huh?"@
` "This room is not supposed to be tobacco-free, isn't it?"@
` "Hey, you're more bitchy than you appear to be, did you know that?"@
` "Uh, that wasn't my intention..."@
` "Is it really that hard to tell for you?"@
` "Y-Yeah, sorry..."\
` "This IS a no-smoking room."@
` "Wha--...@ Coff!@ Coff!"@
` She quickly reaches out a hand and takes the cigarette from my mouth, peeling the filter stuck to my dry lips.@
` "Huh?@ Um..."@
