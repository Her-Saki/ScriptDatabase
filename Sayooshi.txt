` "...!"@
` Spreading her immaculate wings as her long hair becomes more and more disarranged with each wild swing, the angel lets out a suffocated scream, while the monster, with its demonic eye wide open, sways violently its lenghty tentacles and gives a roar akin to the rumbling of an earthquake.\
` Angels are strange creatures.@
` They're beautiful, and that's precisely why they evoke the latent wickedness hidden in the heart of whoever observes them.@
` But if such is the case, can they still be considered "sacred" beings?\
` "...!"@
` The beast, which might as well be called the incarnation of depravity, crawls across the angel's body as if licking it entirely.@
` Restrained by a wave of meaty limbs, the angel is unable to resist them as they penetrate her insides.@
` Creeping like worms, those slimy embodiments of biological hatred rape the angel; the monster's sexual fluids taint her skin and seep into it.\
` "...!"@
` Erosion...
` "...!"@
` Assimilation...
` "...!"@
` Yeah, it'd be most appropriate to call this act "assimilation".\
` The beast looks similar to SOMETHING, but I can't pinpoint exactly what it is.\
` No, in fact...@ it's similar to SOMEONE.\
` Very similar, indeed.@
` But to who, exactly?\
` In the lower part of the beast, tentacles slither covering my field of vision as if a crimson rug was spread before me.@
` The monster turns around to me and opens wide its mouth.@
` A mucous-textured oral cavity...@ which resembles a botomless abyss.@
` As I'm eaten by HIM, the personification of absolute negativity, I'm assaulted by an odd sensation...\
` Fear and relief.@
` Hatred and affection.@
` Inscrutability and understanding.@
` Pollution and purity.@
` Love and hate.@
` Light and darkness.@
` Several contradictory feelings form a torrent and flow inside me...\
` The face of that monster...\
` The face of that angel...\
` My own face...\
` "A nightmare?"@
` The woman wearing a white coat stares fixedly at me.@
` She's Tonae Ohmori, the person I came to see in this room hazy with purple smoke.@
` Outside, the dusk has engulfed everything; in the courtyard I can see from the window, shadows of trees extend a long way, while the orange-shaded light that leaks inside the room dyes Tonae's face amber.\
` "Well, it's no big deal, isn't it?@ That means you're sleeping like a log as you should."@
` "I know, but still..."@
` The sour smell of medicine...@ Our conversations that tend to stagnate more than often...@
` In this room where she's the boss, we puff at cigarettes together.@
` The beds covered by cheap vinyl...@
` The thin curtains that divide them...@
` The dull, silver light reflecting off medical tools...@
` This room, whose atmosphere is completely different from any other, never fails to make me feel a little nervous.@
` Aside from the purple smoke spiraling up to the ceiling, everything inside is motionless.@
` Along with a numbing sensation inside my head,@
` time itself stops its course completely.\
` "A nightmare, huh?@ Care to describe it?"@
` When Tonae draws my attention, I become free from that binding spell and time flows once again.@
` "......"@
` I gaze absent-mindedly at her face without answering immediately.@
` Her pouty lips...@ Her languid, sleepy eyes...@
` And her body whose mature voluptuousness is visible even from outside her white coat.@
` That's not exactly the reason, but I...@ have a hard time dealing with her.\
` Part of the reason I come to this room is because it's one of the few places where I can smoke, but aside from that...@ I think I just want to conversate with her.@
` Since I'm bad at communicating with people, the fact that she always breaks the ice first is a godsend.@
` That's why I frequent this place regularly, but sometimes, as we talk, my awkwardness in regards to her rears its ugly head.@
` It's like a "vicious cycle" of sorts.\
` During the day, countless people come and go from the infirmary.@
` It seems she's well-beloved in the school and everybody counts on her.@
` That's all the more reason I don't find very pleasant to show myself here.@
` It'd be unbearable for me if people thought wrongly that I've fallen for her or that I'm emotionally dependant on her.@
` I think her feminine sexual appeal only makes it easier for those kind of misunderstandings to pop up.@
` But... is it really a misunderstanding?@ What part of all that is actually correct and what isn't?@
` It's a real problem, but I always come back here anyway.\
` Since I came to this school, I've presented myself in her place almost every day when the sun starts sinking in the horizon.\
` She furrows her brows as she gulps in a puff of smoke, exhales slowly, and repeats her question.@
` "So?@ How was it?"@
` "W-Well, the monster..."@
` "There was a monster?"@
` "Yeah..."@
` "It was scary, wasn't it?"@
` "You bet.@ It was creepy as hell...@ I felt like I was going to be swallowed by it."@
` "I see, but...@ it was only a dream, right?@ Is it really something to be concerned about?"@
` "Y-Yeah, I guess you're right..."@
` "A monster, huh?@ Tell me, have you been feeling tired lately?"@
` That's right, I'm exhausted.@ Exhausted about this "teaching practice" I'm engaging in now.\
` "Man, you're too serious for your own good.@ Are you really that worried?"@
` "Huh?@ Are you talking about the teaching practice?"@
` "Nh?@ Teaching practice?"@
` "......"
` "Nah, forget about what I said.@ I get the picture now."@
` "Ah, did you mean the dream?"@
` "Well, it doesn't matter which, really.@ The fact remains that you're racking your brains over it."@
` "Can you make something out of what I told you about the dream?"@
` "I'm afraid not.@ I'm not Jung nor Freud, y'know?"\
` I think she's being rude laughing off my problems like this.@
` However, that's just how she usually is.@
` I drop my gaze down to the hem of her white coat, and hit her with the most spiteful remark I'm able to tell.@
` "You're right.@ You hardly look like a bearded old man."@
` "Hmm..."@
` Tonae stubs out the crop of her cigarette in the ashtray.@
` With a sidelong glance, I see her smile ever so faintly.@
` "I see...@ So you're having trouble with teaching practice, huh?"@
` Perhaps I'm just being paranoid, but the way she talks makes me feel like she's interrogating me.@
` I don't know how to reply, or rather, I can't connect words naturally in my head.@
` I feel like I must by no means say something wrong here.@ A pretty nonsensical obsession to be trapped in.\
` "So...@ Umm...@ You see..."@
` I look desperately for an answer, but as I'm about to speak, a couple of dry knocks in the door interrupt me.@
