` *Click! Click!*@ I stretch the lead of my mechanical pencil again and again as I let it run meaninglessly through my notebook, until eventually, the lead breaks apart and some specks hit my cheek.\
` The sluggish wind swaying the beige curtains makes this class feel even more like a silent, colorless film shot in a faraway world.\
` Inside the classroom lighted by the western sun, the dead-eyed students write down rows upon rows of characters in their notebooks as they gulp in great lungfuls of chalk dust.\
` As weird as it may sound, these recent days I feel like time is advancing in a MUDDY way.@
` As if every day the same film is projected at exactly the same time...@ It's a strange feeling indeed.\
` A repetitive, invariable, futile routine.\
` At some point in time which I'm unable to specify, all the color and sound of this dull world vanished.\
` However, I'm not really affected by it.@ Instead, I embrace this indescribable heat inside me and, as usual, forget myself writing scribbles in my notebook.\
` I let my pencil run silently across the notebook, and draw a circle in a page of my brand-new college notebook, filled with blue ruled lines.@ It's the same circle I'm used to draw every day.@

((#002:))
` This way, I immerse myself in my own wet, sticky dreamworld...\
` The circle represents the Earth.@
` Since I created it, it is only mine.\
` Unfortunately, this Earth of mine I drew will have to be destroyed.@ It's a 1:1 miniature of the Earth where we're all living now.@
` The polluted sky and oceans, the garbage dump-like cities, and the social structure designed for enslaved, lifeless people are exactly like our world.\
` The apocalypse always comes when you least expect it.@
` I draw small circles around the main circle.@ These are explosions from a new type of nuke that burn and destroy everything.@
` All of a sudden, an explosion occurs without warning.@
` The earth splits and cracks, the sky rampages, and flames erupt creating a burning hell.@
` Their fingers and earlobes blown away, people run from the flames aimlessly.@ They escape without knowing what the hell happened to Earth so out of the blue.\
` My apocalyptic fantasy doesn't stop there.\
` However, there's nowhere to escape.@ It's impossible, because the Earth itself is falling apart and is about to disappear.@
` Despite they run so desperately their legs are torn off, and so fast their lungs burn out, there's just no way they can escape from the end of the world.\
` In an automatic motion, I keep drawing more and more circles.@ The places where the nukes explode meet a gruesome, ultimate destruction.@
` As people gradually lose their own world, they kick each other to make way and crawl around the surface looking to shelter themselves.\
` I leave a single safe place on purpose while the rest of the world is being engulfed by flames.@
` After trampling down on others in order to survive, those ugly, pathetic creatures called humans group there to save their lives.@
` As they breathe out poisonous gas from their almost rotten mouths, every single one of them start pleading for mercy.@
` "Please save us!"
` "Why are we being punished?!"\
` I slowly lift my right arm as if teasing them, and as I hear their desperate appeals and screams, I mercilessly draw the last nuke.\
` At that very moment, I feel like I'm actually hearing the screams of millions of people at once.@
` I feel an intense rush of blood through my whole body.\
` This unspeakable excitement makes me feel agitated.@
` Once I wake up from my fantasy, I slowly let go of my pencil and I'm astonished to notice my palm is sweating A LOT.\

((#003:))
` Every time I'm struck with these vivid delusions during the day, I feel shivers fierce enough to make my hair stand on end.@
` However, I can't deny I feel a bit of guilty pleasure when the blood pumps through my veins.\
` During class, there's a part of me that enjoys intoxicating itself with drug-like fantasies, and a part of me that fears the other one.@
` Those wild dreams become more lifelike and realistic every day, and at the same time, the real world becomes more dull and soundless.
` Blazing, blood-pounding insanity on one side, and dry, withered rationality on the other.\
` Perhaps I'm getting far away from this boring reality as I tread little by little into the world of madness...\

((#004:))
` Thinking about that, I let my gaze wander through space, and then...\
` "Huhuhuhu..."@
` I hear a dry laugh echoing through the classroom.@
` Strangely, despite that laugh should be soundless to me, I can hear it loud and clear.@
` "Huhuhuhu..."@
` The students stop writing in their notebooks and turn their heads to that creepy laugh.\
` The student laughing is a girl that sits diagonally to me.@
` Obviously, I know her face.@ However, I can't recall her name.\
` She gazes absent-mindedly outside the window, and despite the teacher didn't even call out to her, she slowly stands up, all while chuckling.@
` As she's illuminated by the western sun, her silhouette is projected in the wall before her, just like a faint shadow picture.\
` "What's wrong, Ohta?"@
` The teacher that was writing rows of characters akin to worms crawling across the blackboard stops his hand holding the chalk.@
` Ohta...@ Yeah, she's Ohta.@ She's one of the student council's board members, and she's always surrounded by a group of girls.@
` "Huhu, huhuhu...@ Haha, hahahahahahaha..."@
` Her giggles turn into a loud laughter, and still facing to the window, she keeps laughing joyfully.\
` The class looks at her a bit spooked.@
` "Hey, what's wrong with Kanako?"@
` "She creeps me out..."@
` The students' whispers mix with Ohta's chuckles.\
` Then, Ohta strikes her desk full-force with both hands.@
` All of a sudden, the classroom becomes dead silent.@
` Before the perplexed stare of the students, she mutters a single word in a low voice:@
` "Sex."\
` After a brief moment, the entire classroom burst into laughter.@
` "Hahahahahahaha!@ That was nasty, Kanako, but really funny!"@
` "Huahahahaha!@ What the fuck, Ohta?!@ You horny or somethin'?!"@
` Without paying attention to the desperate efforts of the teacher to calm things down, the students' hysterical laughter pierces the air and resounds through the classroom.\
` "Huhu, huhuhu.@ Gimme some, c'mon.@ Gimme some dick.@ I can't take it anymore.@ C'mon, be cool.@ I want a dick.@ You hear me?@ A DICK!@ I wanna a dick!@ Put it inside me!@ Thrust it into my hot, wet, drenched pussy!@ I wanna have sex, right here, right now!@ I wanna do iiit...!@ I WANNA FUUUUUCK!!@ Sex, sex, sex, sex, sex SEX SEX SEX SEX SEX SEX SEX SEX SEX SEX SEX SEX...!!"\
` The students' laughs gradually fade out.@
` Just like a broken CD player, she repeats the word "Sex" endlessly.@
` Now, not a single student is laughing anymore.@
` It's clear to everyone that Ohta's not in her right mind.\
` "KYAAAAAAAAAAAH!!"@
` At that moment, a girl's scream breaks apart the desolate atmosphere of the classroom.@
` The students watch the scene with their breath taken away.@
` Ohta tears out her own face scratching it with her nails, and as a result, both of her hands become red with blood.\
` The teacher that was watching dumbfounded comes to his senses and rushes over to Ohta.@
` He holds down her hands, but it's too late.@ Both her face and her uniform are already dyed bright red with blood, a vivid hue that reminds me of tomato juice.@
` Amidst an eerie silence, an abnormal nervousness overwhelms the students.\
` Immediately, two boys along with the teacher holding her down take Ohta, who is competely covered by blood, to the infirmary.\
` After Ohta and the others leave the classroom, the noise resumes and the students begin to make a fuss again, as if they cut a tense thread hanging over them.@
` Every single of the students was creeped out by her sudden self-harming attack.@
` However, as for me...@ I know it's strange, but I felt an indescribable affinity towards her.@
` That's right...@ She entered the realm of madness a bit earlier than me.@ Perhaps that's the reason.@
` After seeing that puddle of bright red blood inside the classroom illuminated by the western sun, bit by bit, reality started to gain color again.\
` Before long, I hear the distant sound of an ambulance coming closer.\

((#005:))
` It's been three days since Ohta's incident.@
` Out of the blue, she lost her mind and began to scratch her own face until turning it into a bloody pulp.\
` According to her family and friends' testimonies, she behaved completely normal before that day.@
` However, she went crazy specifically in the day of the accident.\
` "Y'know?@ The other day I tried to talk with her like usual, and Kanako turned her face slowly with a creeeeepy smile.@
` I kid you not, that was DISGUSTING!@ It was exactly like the face of a ghost I saw in a TV show the other day.@ Maybe by then she had already gone bonkers, who knows?"\
` Naturally, Ohta became the trending topic of every classroom for the next two days after the incident.@
` They say she was hospitalized in a general hospital in order to operate her, and that she'll be transferred to a psychiatric ward next week.@
` People's also spreading careless rumors about the source of her insanity.@
` That she was always neurotic, that she did drugs...@
` There's even a theory according to which her boyfriend cheated on her and she was left so traumatized that wanted someone to rape her.\
` However, as anybody would expect, three days later people got tired of that topic and established a sort of weird "pact of silence", so Ohta's incident became a taboo issue.\
` Until yesterday's afternoon everyone was talking excitedly about Ohta, but as soon as someone suggested making a pact of silence, they immediately turned tails.@
` I think every single of them are coward sheeps.@ They act according to other people's reactions, and instead of holding their own opinion, they follow blindly whatever trash the mass believes.@ They're really stupid.\
` That's why, despite she lost her mind, I can't help but relate to Ohta.\

((#006:))
` Uncommonly, today's break my uncle asked me to come to the teachers' office.\
` My uncle is my father's second little brother.@ He's a contemporary Japanese language teacher that works in this school.@
` Despite he's from my family, we aren't very close.@
` When I was a kid he used to visit my father and me regularly, but in these last ten years he never showed up if not for big family reunions, and as far as personal meeting goes, we had none.@
` We often pass by each other in the hallway, but we only exchange a polite smile or greeting, and that's where our bond ends.\
` Moreover, having a relative teaching in one's school can get pretty... annoying.@
` Not only he doesn't let me know the exams' content beforehand and whatnot, but he leaks secrets about my school life to my parents and vice versa.@
` To make matters worse, despite we treat each other as family, we have to act as a teacher and student in the face of society, which results in awkward situations.@ I find that really irritating.\
` I try to avoid him as much as I can.@
` He knows I find it difficult to deal with our relationship, so he doesn't contact me regularly either.\
` That's why is so rare of him to call me to the staff room.\
` Once I reach the office, I do a small, polite nod, and enter through the door.@
` I look around for my uncle.@
` "Oh, Yuusuke.@ I'm here."@
` When I turn my gaze to the voice, I find my uncle behind a pile of textbooks.@
` As I approach him, he leaves the teacup in his desk and gets up from his chair.@
` "Come to the rooftop."@
` He says patting my shoulder.\
` Carried by him, he takes me up to the rooftop.@
` The mild sunlight and somewhat chilly wind feel refreshing.@ I look out over to observe in a sweep the urban landscape that surrounds the school.\

((#007:))
` "What can I help you with?"@
` I break the ice first.@ Honestly, I think the tone of my speech is not very "familiar".@ Perhaps I should have said "What's the matter?" instead.@
` My uncle takes out a cigarette from his pocket without haste, and lights it with a 100 yen lighter as he covers it from the wind with his hands.@ He inhales the smoke as if he's taking a deep breath, and takes his time to exhale.@
` "Lately the office banned smoking indoors.@ It's hella maddening."@
` Before this unimportant topic he brings up, I only answer "I see".\
` "They say smokers damage non smokers's health and shit.@ They even went as far as declaring it a violation of human rights.@ Now, I'd like to ask them, what about the smokers' human rights, huh?@"
` This sounds pretty egotistical, but I guess that's yet another of my uncle's jokes.\
` "That said, I understand we teachers are disreputable as life guides when we drill in your heads "don't smoke, don't smoke" and then we smoke like chimneys in the office."@
` "Uncle, what did you want to talk about...?"@
` His soliloquy never ends, so I cut the chase.@
` "Nh?@ Oh, yeah..."@
` He throws the cigarette he just lit a moment ago to the floor and steps on it to put out the fire.@ Then...@
` "You got a real surprise on Monday, don't you?"@
` He says out of the blue.\
` "Monday?@ You mean Ohta's incident?"@
` "She's from your class, right?"@
` "Yes, she sits diagonally to me."@
` "Were you friends with that girl?"@
` "No, not really..."\
` I answer unconcernedly as if I were being questioned by a police officer.\
` "She's from your class, so I take you know a lot about her, don't you?"@
` "Know what?"@
` "Rumors and such."@
` "Yes, I heard all sort of things about her, but those rumors were all groundless."@
` "What "things", specifically?"@
` My uncle peeks into my eyes.@
` "For example..."@
` 1. That she was neurotic from the beginning.
` 2. That she consumed illicit substances.

((#008:))
` "I heard that she was neurotic all along."
` "Yeah, that sounds credible."@
` My uncle smiles awkwardly.@
` "From a layman's point of view, one would normally associate a student's mental breakdown with nervous disorders caused by stress, meaning, neurosis.@ Under that perspective, the origin of her insanity could be traced back to problems in her daily life.@ The press in particular tends to emphasize that line of thought.@ They'd argue she was likely a victim of bullying at school, and that the school's management was greatly at fault..."\
` Unintentionally, I picture crazy-driven Ohta in my mind.@
` She was a top member of the student council.@ If I recall correctly, the vice president.@
` She was bright, optimistic, and was always surrounded by a bunch of girls.@ She had a lot of friends, too.@ It's like she lived a in different world than me.\
` "Ohta had nothing to do with bullying, stress or anything of the sort.@ I don't believe she suffered from neurosis."@
` Without even realizing it, I find myself defending her like a lawyer.@ That's probably due to the closeness I feel towards her.@
` "Exactly.@ After investigating a bit, I found nothing in her domestic or school life that could potentially trigger neurosis.@ She was doing well at school, and she had almost no troubles family-wise.@ That's why we're looking for the main cause in other aspects of her life."@
` "Does that mean you have ruled out the possibility of family and school issues?"@
` "Yeah, pretty much.@ I'm only making conjectures, though.@ I have the strong suspicion that were other factors involved.@ What other rumors did you hear?"@

((#009:))
` "They say she consumed illicit substances."@
` "Hmm, judging by the state she was on Monday, she showed all the typical symptoms of a drug addict."@
` "So she was doing drugs, after all?"@
` Unintentionally, I furrow my brows.\
` "No, we only suspected that."@
` My uncle coughs.@
` "In psychatry, psychosis are classified into several categories.@ Alcoholic psychosis, organic psychosis, and of course drug psychosis."@
` "I see..."\
` "And obviously we had a doctor examine her."@
` "What was the diagnosis?"@
` My uncle drops his head slowly.@
` "According to the check-up they ran at the hospital...@ Oh, by the way, she's still hospitalized in a general hospital, but they didn't find a single trace of substances inside her body."@
` "Then the cause lies in another place entirely, right?@ Perhaps she was cornered by a problem her family and friends never knew about."@
` "That's plausible.@ Mental issues are a thing from the mind, though, so we can't take any conclusions as unconditionally true.@ Just because her breakdown happened AFTER a certain incident that doesn't mean the cause was THAT incident.@ Perhaps said event was only the last straw that broke her, and the actual source of the problem was always rooted inside her as potential neurosis."@
` "That said, if we keep following that line of thought we'd only be walking in circles forever, so we focus the investigation on what we actually CAN investigate.@ Anyway, what other rumors did you hear?"@
` He asks me, and I try to recall any other gossips.\

((#010:))
` "Did you call me to help you theorize about this?"@
` "No, there's actually another reason but, c'mon, keep me company a little more.@ Now, tell me, any other rumors you have heard of?"@
` "That she was dumped by her boyfriend, and..."@
` "That she was raped?"@
` It was hard for me to say that, but my uncle spat it out without hesitation.\
` "Yes, there's a theory about a possible sexual assault."@
` "Actually, I think that's where her insanity stems from.@ You share classroom with her, so I'm pretty sure you heard what Ohta screamed as she tore apart her own face."@
` As my uncle tells me that, I picture vividly what happened that day in my mind.\
` That day, Ohta was chuckling while looking outside the window, and then she started to shout dirty words as if she were possessed by a demon.@
` She straight up asked for sex.@ Since Ohta stands out so much among our class, boys reacted inevitably in an oversensitive manner.@
` Judging by her speech, it's possible that the root of her madness has some kind of relation with sex.@
` I think that's what my uncle is trying to say.\
` "Well, I'm only telling you this because it's you, but she already had sexual experience with men.@ It seems she had sex the day previous to the incident."@
` "How do you know that?"@
` "The results of her medical check-up."@
` "Did they go that far...?"@
` I picture Ohta inside a white-walled hospital room as a bunch of unknown doctors examine her intimate zone.@ It feels somewhat revolting.\
` "So you're narrowing down the source of her mental issues to problems with men?"@
` "Yeah."@
` My uncle takes out another cigarette from his breast pocket, puts it into his mouth, and lights it.@ After inhaling the smoke with a deep breath, he points his gaze at the urban landscape beyond the fence.\
` "Ohta's parents said she recently (though we're only talking about two weeks prior to the incident) started to get out frequently by night."@
` Cigarette smoke rises from my uncle's mouth.@
` "Perhaps she went to her boyfriend's house."@
` "No, it seems that's not the case."@
` He directs his gaze to me and curls slightly his lips.\
` "It looks like she came here, to the school, by night.@ Perhaps this part will be nasty to hear, but that's what she wrote in her diary."@
` "So the school investigated even her diary just like the police would do?"@
` "Don't be like that.@ That was also a request from Ohta's parents, and..."@
` "And what?"@
` "If we're not careful, this incident could escalate into a criminal case."\

((#011:))
` "In her diary they found..."@
` My uncle cuts himself short.@
` "It's bizarre.@ She started writing in it three weeks ago.@ It seems she had to come to the school for some reason and she began to write since that day.@ Most pages of the notebook are blank."\
` "What are the contents of the diary?"@
` He shakes his head slightly, exhales a puff of smoke, and simply says "nothing".\
` "It only says "I went to school".@ That's it."\
` 21/2 - Tonight I'm going to school.\
` 22/2 - Tonight I'm going to school.\
` "And so on and so forth.@ Rather than a diary, it feels more like she was keeping track of the days she went to school."@
` "She jotted down those notes before leaving home, right?"@
` "Yeah.@ I don't know why, but I assume she wanted to leave a record that she actually came."@
` "Did she write down her reasons for coming?"@
` "Unfortunately no, she didn't.@ But I don't think she'd came without a good reason."@
` My uncle smiles awkwardly as if he said "well, duh", and gulps in a good lungful of smoke.\
` The wind blows away the cigarette smoke he breathes out and it tickles my nose.@
` "However..."@
` Taking me by surprise, my uncle resumes his explanation out of the blue.@ He has a serious look on his face.@
` "This was written on Sunday, the day prior to the incident."\
` My uncle takes out a piece of paper from his pocket and hands it over to me.@
` "I copied it from her diary."\
` 2/3 - Today I'm not going to school.@ Despite it's Sunday, third year teachers presented themselves at work.@ They'll stay at office until late night, so today I won't go.@
` I can't stand it.@
` I can't stand it.@
` How can the other girls endure this?!@
` I'm going straight to his home.\
` "What do you think about this, Yuusuke?"@
` ""What"?@ I'm not a detective, you know?"@
` "Laymans' opinions can be helpful, too."\
` Without even realizing it, I feel like my uncle is tangling me up more and more in this case.@
` He said this incident could escalate to a criminal case, right?@
` If that's the case, should I be giving freely my opinion like this?\
` My uncle is not just interrogating me; he also wants me to do something afterwards.@ That much is clear.@
` What does he want me to do?@ Heaven knows.@
` Shouldn't I stop here before I get further involved in this incident?@
` However, strangely, I have a strong desire to know everything about this case.\
` Poor Ohta got trapped in the world of insanity...@ That "other" world I see every day.@
` What did she see back there, and what is she seeing now?@
` Perhaps I can move closer to that world by walking the same path as her.@
` 1. I'm fed up with this matter.
` 2. I feel inexplicably attracted to the word "insanity".

((#012:))
` "Insanity".
` I feel an irresistible attraction towards that word.@
` The human spirit is so fragile it can be broken loudly with the slightest of the hits, just like a glass cup.@
` When a person suffers a mental breakdown, people usually says the person is "broken".@
` That means Ohta's "broken" too.\
` However, I think being "broken" has another nuance.@
` It means the person has drifted from this boring reality and "opened" the door to another world that lies just behind ours.\
` A world that only people possessed by insanity can see.@ A world exclusive to them.@
` It's the world of a deranged human soul, which might as well be governed by pain, pleasure, be a boundless, incomprehensible chaos, or endless, empty darkness.@
` What if there's a way to open that door without relying on drugs or alcohol?\
` Perhaps Ohta did it on purpose, or maybe she didn't...@ No, I'm sure she didn't wish for it, but regardless, the fact is that she opened the door.\
` I'm about to cross that door...@
` which Ohta has already opened.\
` Sanity, MADNESS...@ Pain, PLEASURE...@ Reality, FANTASY...@ Normality, ABNORMALITY...@ Reason, DESIRE...@ Restrain, FREEDOM...@
` I...\
` "So?@ What do you make out of this, Yuusuke?"@
` "Hmm, that's right...@
` "What is right?"@
` "I should look for my own door to insanity."@
` ""Door"?@ The hell you're talking about, Yuusuke...?"@
` My uncle has a puzzled look on his face.@
` I let out a chuckle and take a look at the note once more.\
` 2/3 - Today I'm not going to school.@ Despite it's Sunday, third year teachers presented themselves at work.@ They'll stay at office until late night, so today I won't go.@
` I can't stand it.@
` I can't stand it.@
` How can the other girls endure this?!@
` I'm going straight to his home.\
` "What could "can't stand it" mean?"@
` "You mean from the note?"@
` I suddenly go back to the subject, and my uncle cracks a perplexed, awkward smile.@
` "At first glance we thought it was related to drugs, but that wasn't the case, so we suspect she's talking about having sex with her boyfriend or someone else."@
` If the diagnosis they ran at the hospital was correct, then that's the most logical conclusion.@
` My uncle's reasoning is very solid.\
` However, there are still some loose threads left.@
` "But, umm...@ Can someone reach a drug addict-like state just from sex abstinence?"@
` I can't express my opinion firmly.@ After all, only experienced people know about that...@
` "Well, that depends on the person.@ It's not unthinkable for a high school girl to have a sexual drive higher than the average, and it'd be even more common if we talk about nowadays' girls."\
` "Aside from March 2nd, Ohta always left for school, right?@ Can we conclude she stayed up every night until late hours doing that kind of thing?"@
` "Yeah, pretty much."@
` "Why it had to be specifically at school?@ She could have chosen a hotel or her own house."@
` "Hotels cost money, and at home her family would suspect.@ On the other hand, the school is close and no one stays at night.@ It's pretty convenient depending on how you see it."@
` My uncle's rationale is sound, but I still feel something's not right.\
` "Perhaps doing it at school turned her on."@
` "Are you implying she was a pervert...?"@
` "Given this document, anything is possible.@ We'd know right away if she wasn't SO reputable, though."@
` A wicked smile appears on my uncle's face.\
` "So let's assume Ohta was a sexual degenerate and had intercourse every night at school.@ Does that mean she lost her mind just because a single day of abstinence as her diary shows?"@
` "No, perhaps I forgot to mention it, but when it comes to psychatric illnesses, we can't establish any direct cause.@ However, it's very likely that her abstinence acted as a trigger for the downfall that led to her breakdown.@ The medics didn't find any substances inside her, but there's also a possibility that she used to drink alcohol on a regular basis."\
` "I know, but..."@
` Let's say, for the sake of argument, that every deduction my uncle said is true and correct.@
` That means I knew only a portion of Ohta's true self.@
` Despite I have no concern regarding her personality, I can't help but picture Ohta as the OPPOSITE of a pervert or a skank.@
` But of course, that's merely my personal opinion.\
` "Let's say..."@
` My uncle coughs out a lungful of smoke.@
` "That Kanako met with a boy in secret (probably a student from our school) every night at school to have sex.@ That'd be a HUGE problem for the school management.@ However, there's something even worse written in this note."@
` I return my gaze to the note as he says this.\
` "How can the other girls endure this?!"\
` "There it says "other girls"."@
` "Does that mean there's more people other than Ohta coming to school secretly?"@
` "Yeah.@ Judging by her wording, Ohta's not the only one participating in these meetings."@
` My uncle throws the cropped cigarette at his feet and treads on it with the toe of his shoe.@ That's the second cigarette butt of the day.\
` "In short, a boy and a girl are using our sacred school every night as a hotel.@ That alone is material for a big scandal, but to add insult to injury, it turns out that they're a GROUP of teenagers making wild sexual parties.@ It sounds totally like the story of a B tier variety show."@
` "And Ohta's mental breakdown makes it even worse, doesn't it?"@
` "Remember that we talked about rape?"@
` "Yes."@
` "What we're really worried about is if rape is thrown into the mix.@ That'd turn this mess into a full-fledged criminal case.@ If that's really what's going on, we better gotta brace ourselves for the shitstorm."\
` "And how's the school dealing with this?@ I figure they won't tell the police in order to avoid making the scandal public but, are you investigating alone?"@
` "No, there's several people involved.@ We patrolled the school at night taking turns."@
` "You did nightly rounds?@ How did that go?"@
` "We found nothing.@ It was a complete waste of time."@
` "What if that group stops gathering after what happened to Ohta?"\
` "I hope so..."@
` My uncle says with a deep sigh.@
` "One of her partners suffered a mental breakdown and was hospitalized, and the school has started investigating the matter, so I believe they won't act careless from now on."@
` "That's right, but remember what was written in Kanako's diary..."\
` "Despite it's Sunday, third year teachers presented themselves at work.@ They'll stay at office until late night..."\
` "They're keeping an eye on us, the teachers.@ Perhaps our investigation was leaked to them.@ In fact, last night the athletics club stayed up late and a girl witnessed some suspicious shadows lurking in the area."@
` This has become totally a detective show.\
` "And that's where you enter the stage."@
` Suddenly, my uncle raises the tone of his voice and looks at me directly.@
` "Would you help me investigate the case?"\
` "Huh?"@
` I ask back.@
` "I think it'd best if someone that doesn't stand out late at school, like a student, investigates.@ That'd be you."@
` This is a bit too abrupt.@
` "I understand your point, but..."@
` I'm at a loss for words.@
` 1. Sorry, but I don't think I'm fit for the task.
` 2. Okay, I accept.

((#013:))
` "What are you trying to make me do?@ I feel that you're about to give me a bothersome task."@
` "Hmm, you're sharp.@ That's exactly what I was aiming for.@ I'll tell you the details later, but for now, just answer my questions."@
` My uncle laughs as if he's plotting something up his sleeve.@
` Whenever he smiles like that, nothing good is bound to happen.\
` "So, Yuusuke, what's your opinion after reading the diary?"@
` Letting out a sigh, I let my gaze run across the note once more.\
((MIRRORED FROM #012))
2/3 - Today I'm not going to school.@ Despite it's Sunday, third year teachers presented themselves at work.@ They'll stay at office until late night, so today I won't go.@
` I can't stand it.@
` I can't stand it.@
` How can the other girls endure this?!@
` I'm going straight to his home.\
` "What could "can't stand it" mean?"@
` "You mean from the note?"@
` I suddenly go back to the subject, and my uncle cracks a perplexed, awkward smile.@
` "At first glance we thought it was related to drugs, but that wasn't the case, so we suspect she's talking about having sex with her boyfriend or someone else."@
` If the diagnosis they ran at the hospital was correct, then that's the most logical conclusion.@
` My uncle's reasoning is very solid.\
` However, there are still some loose threads left.@
` "But, umm...@ Can someone reach a drug addict-like state just from sex abstinence?"@
` I can't express my opinion firmly.@ After all, only experienced people know about that...@
` "Well, that depends on the person.@ It's not unthinkable for a high school girl to have a sexual drive higher than the average, and it'd be even more common if we talk about nowadays' girls."\
` "Aside from March 2nd, Ohta always left for school, right?@ Can we conclude she stayed up every night until late hours doing that kind of thing?"@
` "Yeah, pretty much."@
` "Why it had to be specifically at school?@ She could have chosen a hotel or her own house."@
` "Hotels cost money, and at home her family would suspect.@ On the other hand, the school is close and no one stays at night.@ It's pretty convenient depending on how you see it."@
` My uncle's rationale is sound, but I still feel something's not right.\
` "Perhaps doing it at school turned her on."@
` "Are you implying she was a pervert...?"@
` "Given this document, anything is possible.@ We'd know right away if she wasn't SO reputable, though."@
` A wicked smile appears on my uncle's face.\
` "So let's assume Ohta was a sexual degenerate and had intercourse every night at school.@ Does that mean she lost her mind just because a single day of abstinence as her diary shows?"@
` "No, perhaps I forgot to mention it, but when it comes to psychatric illnesses, we can't establish any direct cause.@ However, it's very likely that her abstinence acted as a trigger for the downfall that led to her breakdown.@ The medics didn't find any substances inside her, but there's also a possibility that she used to drink alcohol on a regular basis."\
` "I know, but..."@
` Let's say, for the sake of argument, that every deduction my uncle said is true and correct.@
` That means I knew only a portion of Ohta's true self.@
` Despite I have no concern regarding her personality, I can't help but picture Ohta as the OPPOSITE of a pervert or a skank.@
` But of course, that's merely my personal opinion.\
` "Let's say..."@
` My uncle coughs out a lungful of smoke.@
` "That Kanako met with a boy in secret (probably a student from our school) every night at school to have sex.@ That'd be a HUGE problem for the school management.@ However, there's something even worse written in this note."@
` I return my gaze to the note as he says this.\
` "How can the other girls endure this?!"\
` "There it says "other girls"."@
` "Does that mean there's more people other than Ohta coming to school secretly?"@
` "Yeah.@ Judging by her wording, Ohta's not the only one participating in these meetings."@
` My uncle throws the cropped cigarette at his feet and treads on it with the toe of his shoe.@ That's the second cigarette butt of the day.\
` "In short, a boy and a girl are using our sacred school every night as a hotel.@ That alone is material for a big scandal, but to add insult to injury, it turns out that they're a GROUP of teenagers making wild sexual parties.@ It sounds totally like the story of a B tier variety show."@
` "And Ohta's mental breakdown makes it even worse, doesn't it?"@
` "Remember that we talked about rape?"@
` "Yes."@
` "What we're really worried about is if rape is thrown into the mix.@ That'd turn this mess into a full-fledged criminal case.@ If that's really what's going on, we better gotta brace ourselves for the shitstorm."\
` "And how's the school dealing with this?@ I figure they won't tell the police in order to avoid making the scandal public but, are you investigating alone?"@
` "No, there's several people involved.@ We patrolled the school at night taking turns."@
` "You did nightly rounds?@ How did that go?"@
` "We found nothing.@ It was a complete waste of time."@
` "What if that group stops gathering after what happened to Ohta?"\
` "I hope so..."@
` My uncle says with a deep sigh.@
` "One of her partners suffered a mental breakdown and was hospitalized, and the school has started investigating the matter, so I believe they won't act careless from now on."@
` "That's right, but remember what was written in Kanako's diary..."\
` "Despite it's Sunday, third year teachers presented themselves at work.@ They'll stay at office until late night..."\
` "They're keeping an eye on us, the teachers.@ Perhaps our investigation was leaked to them.@ In fact, last night the athletics club stayed up late and witnessed some suspicious shadows lurking in the area."@
` This has become totally a detective show.\
` "And that's where you enter the stage."@
` Suddenly, my uncle raises the tone of his voice and looks at me directly.@
` "Would you help me investigate the case?"\
` "Huh?"@
` I ask back.@
` "I think it'd best if someone that doesn't stand out late at school, like a student, investigates.@ That'd be you."@
` This is a bit too abrupt.@
` "I understand your point, but..."@
` I'm at a loss for words.@ ((\MIRRORED))

((#014:))
` "Okay, I accept."@
` I mutter in a low voice.@
` After hearing that, my uncle pats my shoulders with a smile of satisfaction.@
` "You'll do it?@ Good."@
` "But please don't expect a great job from me.@ They'll be wary of me even if I'm only a student."@
` "This investigation is based merely on my guesses and conjectures, so just survey things a bit and if you find nothing, then leave it there.@ As long as the upper echelon gets a satisfactory answer, we're gold."\
` My uncle taps my shoulders again.@
` "Once the inspection is done, I'll pay you for the part-time job you did.@ The cheap pay of a local public officer."@
` "Thank you..."@
` "If there's something you don't know, just drop by my desk at the office.@ I usually spent my free time drinking coffee or smoking there.@ You already know the phone number of my house, don't you?"@
` "Yes, I do."\
` "Nice.@ Can you start tonight?"@
` "Not a problem on my end, but...@ Oh, by the way..."@
` "What is it?"@
` "If you have another clue, please tell me."@
` "I think I already told you everything I know..."@
` "You said a girl of the athletics club saw some suspicious, person-like shadows.@ Could you tell me her name?"@
` "Ah, it's Shinjo from the female volleyball club.@ Saori Shinjo.@ If I recall correctly, she's from 2-D class..."\
` Saori Shinjo, volleyball club, 2-D class.@ Got it.@
` I should ask her some info for reference.\
` "Ah, I should explain to you how to enter the school entrance by night."@
` "Oh, yes, that's important."@
` "The front entrance is linked to a security company, and in order to enter you need a key and a security code.@ The code for the door is 0824.@ That's the day the school was founded, August 24th.@ Use the mnemonic device "weight, plenty for" to remember it.@
` ""Weight, plenty for", huh?@ 
` "Yeah."@
` I feel bad for my uncle, but it'd be easier for me to just remember "0824".\
` "*Ding-Dong-Ding-Dong!*"\
` At that moment, the warning bell for the afternoon classes rings.@
` It's 12:55.@
` "Oh, look at the hour."@
` My uncle looks at his wristwatch.\
` "Anyway, if you have any question, come to my desk anytime."@
` "Yes, I will."@
` "Alright, I'm counting on you."@
` My uncle says turning his back to me.@
` "Sure.@ I'll be looking forward to that part-time job pay."@
` My uncle startles a bit with my reminder, but shrugs and waves to me as he leaves.\
` 1. I'll stay at the rooftop for a while more.
` 2. I'll head back to my classroom.
` Okay, what I'm gonna do now?

((#015:))
` "The fact that it could escalate into a criminal case is all the more reason for not involving myself in it."@
` "Well, if you put it like that, I can't quite reply anything, but if possible, I'd like you to cooperate with me."\
` "Don't even joke about it, please.@ What are you going to do if I fall into danger?"@
` "You're completely right.@ That's why I'm asking you to respect your opinion."@
` "In that case, my answer is NO.@ First off, how can you involve a student in such a risky case?"@
` "Ugh..."@
` Struck in a weak point, my uncle reacts exaggeratedly.\
` "I-I plan to compensate you with a part-time job pay..."@
` "Working part-time is against the school rules."@
` "Uuh..."@
` After taking yet another blow, my uncle reacts even more exaggeratedly.\
` "I'm sorry, but please look for someone else.@ Also, I think it'd be better for the school to stop obsessing so much with keeping its reputation and start a real police investigation at once."@
` As he hears what I have to say, he makes a sour face.@
` "That inflexible side of yours is exactly like your father's.@ Both of you are upright and experts at hitting people where it hurts..."@
` "I think YOU are too easygoing."@
` "Yeah, like I said, two birds of a feather."\
` After talking for a while more, I decline formally his proposal.@
` He kept a disappointed look on his face, but I don't have anything to do with this.
` I didn't say anything to my uncle, but just like Ohta, I'm about to open the door to insanity.@
` If I tread further into that realm, I know I won't be able to return to this world ever again.\
` I plan to go there someday.@
` I want to open that door that leads to madness and head to that world beyond this one...@
` However, it's still too early for that.@
` The door slips in and out of my view, just like a mirage.@
` I'm at the stage where I'm slowly tumbling down my way to it.@
` It's no use to try to reach it myself.@
` Someday the door will come naturally to me.@
` So, for now,@
` I'll keep waiting...\

((#016:))
` I sigh as I watch my uncle leave, and then point my gaze towards the landscape beyond the fence.\
` I took on a troublesome business.@
` I already have a hunch that this matter will become more messy than I expect.@
` If this really turns out to be the dangerous incident that my uncle thinks it is, perhaps I shouldn't meddle in it at all.@
` If I'm not careful, I could be putting myself in danger.@
` I give a slight sigh.\
` You may say it was just meant to happen, but now that I accepted to cooperate, there's no turning back.@
` I'll start investigating as soon as today.@
` First of all, I'll go and meet Shinjo.@
` I should probably interview her next break.@
` Classes are about to start, so I'll do it after they're over.@
` Anything I'm gonna do I should do it after I'm done with classes.\
` I turn back to the entrance that leads to the stairs in order to return to my classroom, but then...@
` "!"@
` I see a girl standing up just before me.@
` I didn't notice her presence at all.@ Despite she didn't say a word, I startled so much I feel my heart is about to escape from my throat.\
` Before my surprise, she narrows her eyes and chuckles.@
` "Sorry for scaring you."@
` She says despite she keeps giggling.@
` Automatically, her laughter reminds me of Ohta.@
` I know this girl.\
` Ruriko Tsukishima.\
` We shared class last year, but I never had a conversation with her.@
` "How long have you been there, Tsukishima?"@
` "Since last year.@
` "Huh?"@
` Unintentionally, I furrow my eyebrows.@
` "I've been here since last year, Yuusuke Nagase."@
` I'm at a loss for words before her incomprehensible answer, but my conscious is focused on the fact that she remembers my full name.\
` Tsukishima is a beautiful girl.@ A beauty that surpassed girl in our class from last year...@ No, all girls from every year.@
` I think she's way prettier than those models that appear on TV commercials, or even finely crafted french dolls.\
` She's a hard-to-approach bishojo, and on top of that, she's always reading books.@ She's a very quiet girl.@
` If she were a character from an old classical novel, she'd probably be described as a closeted maiden.@
` That's why I never talked to her.@
` Not only I, but all the boys of our class had a hard time communicating with her.@
` But that same Tsukishima remembers my name.@
` My FULL name, even.@
` That makes me a little happy.\
` "Since last year?@ You mean you've been here literally for a whole year?"@
` "Yes.@ I think I was here a year ago today, as long as it didn't rain, of course."@
` Tsukishima says chuckling again.@
` Influenced by her, I laugh too.@
` This is unexpected.@ I didn't know Tsukishima used to joke like this.@
` "I have a good reception on sunny days."@
` Tsukishima says all of a sudden.@ She smiles innocently like a child, and looks up to the sky.@
` She reaches both of her white arms towards the sun as a strong gush of wind blows through her.@
` "It's just like radio signals."\
` "Huh?@ What is it?"@
` "I can hear them clearly on sunny days, but when it rains, they become static noise just like the sound of the rain."@
` "You mean the radio?"@
` "Both sound like static, but the static of the radio is not the same as the sound of the rain.@ The raindrops absorb the radio's electromagnetic waves and they're washed away to the drainage, so they don't reach home properly.@ That's why, on rainy days, you should open a subterranean manhole and get under there to listen to them clearly."@
` "What are you talking about, Tsukishima?"@
` "Denpa waves."\
` "Denpa waves?"@
` "Yes.@ I'm collecting denpa waves every day.@ Usually, though, I use a metallic antenna to catch the normal waves."@
` I don't have the faintest idea what's she on about.@
` Radio?@ Denpa waves?@ Antennas?@
` "However, I can't catch my own denpa waves with an antenna, so I use my own body instead.@ I become an antenna myself."\
` 1. "So, basically, you're catching denpa waves here in the rooftop."
` 2. "I don't understand anything about antennas, denpa waves or anything like that."
` What exactly is Tsukishima talking about?

((#019:))
` "So, in short, you're collecting denpa waves here, right?"@
` I didn't understand much of what she said, but strangely, I believe that she's telling the truth without questioning it.@
` Moreover, I don't feel she's poking fun at myself in the slightest.\
` "Yes.@ People usually place antennas in elevated places, right?@ They put satellital antennas in the highest place of buildings.@ That's why I must come to the highest place of the school."@
` As she chuckles again, her eyes look pretty much like Ohta's eyes back in that day.@
` The eyes of a broken person after suferring a mental breakdown.@
` The look of someone who opened the door to insanity.\
` I can tell.@
` This Tsukishima before me is not the same Tsukishima I knew a year ago.@
` This is Tsukishima after she opened the door to insanity.\
` But... why would she open it in the first place?\
` "You're just like me, aren't you, Nagase?"@
` "Huh?"@
` She said that so suddenly that my heart jumped at the thought she read my mind, but that wasn't actually the case.@
` "You can do it too, can't you, Nagase?"@
` "D-Do what?"@
` "Receive the denpa waves."@
` Tsukishima stares at me with her serene, beatiful eyes.\

((#020:))
` "I don't know anything about these antennas and denpa waves you're talking about."@
` I feel Tsukishima is telling me nonsense on purpose to confuse me.@
` I wonder if she's making fun of me.@
` Yeah, that must be it.@
` If not for that, there'd be no reason for Tsukishima to be talking with me.\
` "Are you poking fun at me?"@
` "No.@ I'm telling you about the denpa waves."@
` "You seriously think you can transform into a antenna that receives denpa waves?"@
` "Yes."\
` "No human can do that."@
` "Yes, I can.@ For starters, human thoughts are..."@
` "Stop messing with me!"@
` "!"@
` I yell unintentionally.@
` Tsukishima retracts her head in surprise and points her clear eyes towards me.\
` "S-Sorry, I'm racking my brains over mental illnesses right now.@ I'd rather not listen anything about denpa waves or anything of the sort."@
` Tsukishima shows me a sad expression.@
` Perhaps she got fed up of my party pooper attitude.\
` "You're just like everyone else, huh?"@
` Tsukishima says.\
` Tsukishima closes her eyes, turns on her heels, crosses the door and climb down the stairs sluggishly.\
` She has become a mysterious girl.@
` She's now a different person from the girl I used to know back then.@
` I wonder what happened to her...\

((#021:))
` "I don't have that power within me..."@
` It's fine that I went along with her joke, but I feel I'm just ridiculing her.@
` So, instead, I'll tell her the truth.@
` "I'm sorry that I'm not like you."@
` "No, you DO have the power.@ You're way more powerful than me."@
` As she talks, she grips my hand softly and moves it close to her chest.\
` Her white, soft, and slightly cold hand grabs mine delicately.@
` "It's happening as we speak.@ The denpa particles I collected are flowing towards you one after the other.@ Can you feel it?"@
` Tsukishima tilts her head a bit and narrows her eyes.\
` *Thump* *Thump* *Thump*...@
` I hear my own heart beating fast.\
` It's a strange feeling indeed.@ The core of my body is heating up, and my skin is sweating.@ Static runs across my brain and my field of vision bounces and shakes.@
` Just like she said, it feels like denpa particles flowing to my insides.\
` Am I nervous,@
` or perhaps am I excited?@
` Did I always like Tsukishima so much?\
` Behind us a whirlwind messes up with our hair.@
` Her hair dancing in the wind touches my cheeks.@
` Her thin, soft hair...@
` After the wind passed, strangely, my heart becomes as quiet as if nothing happened.\
` A brief silence takes place.@
` It feels as if time itself stopped, and I go back to that sensation I'm so used to feel.@
` Back to this colorless, mute world.\
` "See?"@
` Slowly, Tsukishima lets go of my hands she was holding.@
` At that instant, the world reverts to its original state.@
` "Do you understand now?"@
` "No, I think not."\
` "Don't worry, you'll awake your powers sooner or later."@
` "Awake?@ You mean the denpa particles?"@
` "The power of denpa waves...@ You have great talent for it."@
` Tsukishima blurts out nonsense again.@
` "Huh?@ Talent?@ What for?"@
` "I'll tell you when the time comes."@
` She smiles naively.\
` Tsukishima used to be as beautiful as hard to approach.@
` Way, way more beautiful than TV models and finely crafted french dolls.\
` But now...@ I think she's really adorable.\

((#022:))
` "By the way, you're Mr. Nagase's relative, aren't you?@ I didn't know that."@
` Unexpectedly, Tsukishima brings up that topic.@
` "So you overheard us, huh?"@
` "No, I didn't hear you guys.@ I received your denpa waves."\
` It looks like Tsukishima overheard our conversation from beginning to end.@
` What do I do?@
` It was supposed to be classified intel...\
` "Um, Tsukishima..."@
` "You can call me Ruriko, Naga."@
` She changed "Nagase" to "Naga".@ However, I think it's more natural of her new self to call me like that.\
` "Ruriko, please don't tell anybody about what you just heard... I mean, received."@
` "Do you mean your conversation with Mr. Nagase?"@
` "Yes."@
` "Huhuhu", Ruriko laughs.\
` "That's right, it's supposed to be a top-secret investigation."@
` As I feared, Ruriko hea--... received the whole conversation.@
` "Y-Yeah, so, please..."@
` "I know how to keep secrets, you know?"@
` "Okay.@ It's a promise, then."@
` "Yes, of course."\
` *Ding-Dong-Ding-Dong!*\
` Then, the afternoon bell to return to classes rings.@
` It's 13:00 P.M.@
` "It's time to go back.@ Anyway, remember you promised."@
` "Yes."@
` Ruriko holds out her pinky finger.@
` "?"@
` "Won't you do a pinky promise?"@
` "O-Oh, sure."\
` She looks like a child unmindful of the filth of the world.@
` I wonder what happened to her in the year we stayed apart...@
` I'm sorry for my uncle, but more than Ohta, I feel like I want to know this girl better.\
` I tangle my finger with Ruriko's slender pinky.@
` We exchange promises, and then I leave that place.\

((#023:))
` As my thoughts cross each other without forming any concrete idea, the first period of afternoon classes ends.@
` It's now break time.@
` The crowd of students is reflected in my eyes like a liquid 8mm film.@
` Since that day, the world has never lost its sound or color again.@
` I guess the possibility that something interesting or even outwordly could happen here keeps me tied to this world.\
` During the break, a girl comes to my seat to talk with me.@
` "Umm, you're Yuusuke Nagase, correct?"@
` I turn around to her voice, and I see her right before me.@ She has short hair and glasses.@
` I'm pretty sure she's from 2nd year just like me since I've seen her a couple of times before, but I don't remember her name.@
` "Yes, why?"@
` "I came to bring you the key as Mr. Nagase told me to do."@
` "Oh, thanks."\
` She hands me the key she was holding in her hand.@
` It's a brand-new, never-used key forged by a locksmith.@
` It looks like this is the master key for the school building.@ With this I should be able to open every door in the school, except for the front entrance, though, since it requires the access code.@
` "Umm..."@
` It seems she still wants to tell me something after she gave me the key.\
` "Uhh...@ The teacher told me..."@
` The girl talks self-effacingly.@
` "Huh?@ What?"@
` "Nagase...@ Ah, you share last names with Mr. Nagase, so perhaps I should call you "Yuusuke" instead...@ Anyway, Yuusuke, I heard you're investigating about Kanako.@ Is that true?"@
` "How do you know?"@
` "Mr. Nagase told me about it."\
` I drop my jaw unintentionally.@
` "He told you?"@
` "Yes."@
` I'm so shocked I don't find the words to reply.@
` What is my uncle thinking?@ I don't get it.@ Didn't he send me to investigate because he already suspected the teacher's investigation was leaked to the culprits?@
` It's entirely possible that this girl is also one of them.@
` That said, I can hardly imagine her as such.\
` "What did he tell you, specifically?"@
` I have to verify how much she knows.@
` "He only gave me a brief explanation.@ Mr. Nagase said the cause of Kana--...@ Ohta's breakdown could have been some weird reunions she participated in.@ He also told me that you'll come to school tonight to investigate the matter."@
` It looks like he didn't inform her the details, only the gist of it.\
` "Yeah, that's right."@
` I take a look around and talk in a low voice, making sure none of the students is overhearing us.@
` "We don't know where the culprits could be hiding, so I'd like to keep the investigation as low-profile as possible."@
` "I understand.@ Otherwise it'd be pointless to send you to investigate."@
` It seems we agree on that part...\
` "Um, I have a little request if you don't mind."@
` She gazes at me with a serious look.@
` She's well-mannered, but I feel her eyes give off a sort of intense aura.@
` "A request?"@
` She takes her right hand up to her chest, and...@
` "Please let me help you with the investigation."@
` she says.@
` "Is that an order from my uncle?"@
` "No, he refused because "it'll be at late hours and dangerous.""@
` "He's right.@ The inspection will take place quite late at night, even as late as midnight.@ It's no big deal for me since my house is near, but..."@
` "That's not a problem for me.@ I live nearby, too."\
` "Besides, your family would be worried.@ You're a girl, so I bet your father would make a fuss about it."@
` "I only live with my mother, but...@ I'll be fine.@ She's a very understanding person."\
` "But it's still dangerous, and we don't know what could happen there."@
` "I think you'd be more reassured with a partner by your side.@ Also, despite I may not look like it, I'm very athletic."\
` "I don't believe the investigation will make good progress just because you're there."@
` "No, I think I'll be helpful.@ I'm a member of the student council, so I know about the club activities and the school's structure better than the average student, and..."@
` "You belong to the student council?"@
` "Y-Yes, I do.@ I'm the secretary.@ Oh, silly me, I never told you my name, didn't I?"@
` "No, you didn't."@
` "S-Sorry.@ I'm Mizuho Aihara."@
` Mizuho Aihara, the secretary.\
` The fact that she belongs to the student council means she must be very close to Ohta.@
` After all, she was the student council's vice president.\
` "Were you an acquaintance of hers?"@
` "No, not just an acquaintance..."@
` She says dropping her head in sadness.@
` "Kanako was my best friend since middle school."@
` "Oh, I... see."@
` "I entered this high school and enrolled myself in the student council just to be close to her.@ We were always together, even the day prior to the incident..."@
` "You mean Sunday?"@
` "Yes, we hung out that day.@ We went shopping, watched a movie, ate hamburgers..."@
` "How was she that day?@ Was she any different from usual?"@
` "No.@ She was the same Kanako I always knew and loved."\
` "So she behaved as usual, correct?"@
` "Yes.@ However, the next day..."@
` Mizuho becomes disheartened.@
` "I passed by her in the hallway and greeted her as usual, and..."@
` "And?"@
` "And she looked back to me, but...@ But she passed me by and ignored me...@ I thought I had offended her somehow, and called out to her again, but..."@
` Her eyes dampen.\
` "W-When I tried to stop her, Kanako brushed me away...@ She said "let go", and then..."@
` Mizuho wipes her tears with the back of her clenched hands.@
` After that, Ohta probably said something unspeakable to Mizuho.@
` "Kanako...@ Kanako..."\
` "I understand now.@ That's why you want to help with the investigation so badly, isn't it?"@
` Still wiping her tears, Mizuho nods.@ She's weeping quietly as her shoulders tremble.@
` Regardless of the reason, I made a girl cry before me, so I can't help but worry about the glares of everyone around.@
` "Okay, I got it.@ I'll call you later, so could you wait until then?"\
` "Yes, I will."@
` "What is your class?"@
` "It's A."@
` That's the class next to mine.@ That explains why I recalled seeing her before.@
` "Whenever I'm not in the classroom, I stay at the student council."@
` "Got it.@ "A" classroom or the student council, correct?"@
` "Yes."@
` Mizuho nods with teary eyes.@
` "Alright, see you later."@
` I tell her as to wrap up our meeting.@ She then makes a little farewell gesture as she rubs her eyes and takes her leave.@
` By the time she turns around, she already wiped her tears and her mouth was shut tight.\
` She appears to be a glass-hearted crybaby, but perhaps she possess a strong soul on the inside.\
` Mizuho Aihara, the student council's secretary...@
` Now that I think about it calmly, letting Mizuho join the survey could be advantageous just like she said.@
` Maybe her help would make the inspection go smoothly.@
` It could be worth it to consider her seriously for the job.\

` *Ding-Dong-Ding-Dong!*@
` The last bell rings putting an end to the classes of the day.\
` As students from different classrooms visit each other, the mood becomes rowdier than usual.@
` Some students stay to participate in club activities and others stay for supplementary lessons, while others go straight home.@
` After I'm done preparing myself to return home, I leave my bag on the desk and stand up.\
` Alright, time for the investigation.@
` That said, I have no clue where to start.@
` My uncle gave me a pretty annoying homework...\
` Out of the blue, my classmate Kanako Ohta suffered a mental breakdown.@
` She left a meaningful diary behind.@
` In that diary, which seems to be written as a means to communicate with someone else, is written the possible cause of her madness as if it were a riddle.@
` And those contents can potientially turn this incident into a full-blown criminal case.\
` For some reason, Ohta came to school every night since two or three weeks prior to her breakdown.@
` What exactly she did there is a mystery, but according to a medical check-up performed on her in a hospital, evidence shows she had sexual intercourse with a boy.@
` This brings up the question of whether she performed said acts in school or not.\
` Using their sacred academy as a hot-pillow joint is a severe problem for the school's management.@
` Also, Ohta mentioned in her diary that many people participate in these clandestine meetings.@
` In case of drugs, alcohol and rape involved in this case, the problem becomes huge.@
` That's why the school wants to deal with it personally before the polices chimes in.\
` By coincidence, the teacher assigned to solve this problem was my uncle.@
` Given how lazy my uncle is, I bet he reluctantly accepted the orders from the upper echelon.@
` Anyway, he must give a satisfactory report to the big shots of the school below the principal.\
` My uncle and the other teachers went to patrol the school at night as the diary suggested.@
` However, they closed up that investigation because they didn't find anything.@
` My uncle could have just reported "there was nothing abnormal" and call it a day...\
` But he didn't.@
` After all, a passage in Ohta's diary revealed that the participants of the orgy were surveiling the teachers.\
` If the teachers were surveiled, it could be that they would be wary of the investigation of last night.@
` The source of the leak and if they're monitoring the teachers minutely is unknown, but the fact is that they didn't appear.@
` No, perhaps they never existed in the first place.@
` Yeah.@ Maybe it was all Ohta's delusion...\
` Nevertheless, that wasn't enough to clear my uncle's suspicions.@
` Then, my uncle decided to approach the case from a different perspective.@
` If the teachers were monitored, what if someone other than the teachers investigated?@
` Someone aside from them that doesn't arise suspicion being in the school.@
` A student.@
` It was only natural that my uncle appealed to me, his nephew, for this task.\
` I accepted my uncle's request.@
` That's why I must investigate if what Ohta wrote is true.@
` I'm positive...@
` that despite how wary are the participants, they will have another clandestine meeting as soon at the school looses their grip.\
` The reason is stated in Ohta's diary.@
` For some reason, they can't stand a single day without having intercourse.@
` Juding by her writing, she was like a drug addict starving to consume substances.@
` So (and I'm aware this may sound too simplistic) perhaps the other members are just like her.@
` That's merely what I imagine, though.\
` Anyway, the survey will take place tonight.@
` I already received the master key needed to enter the school and the access code, 0824.@
` Now all that is left is to wait for the night to come.@
` However, there's some prep work I'd like to do before.@
` That is, collecting information.@
` For the meantime, there's two students that can serve as intel sources.\
` The first one is Mizuho Aihara, from 2-A class.@
` She's the student's council secretary and Ohta's longtime friend.@ Ohta was also part of the student council as president.@
` Since she belongs to the student council, she's very knowledgeable of the school, and she herself is eager to engage in the survey.@
` Perhaps she knows about how was Ohta with her friends before the incident and if there was something strange with her.\
` The second one is Saori Shinjo from 2-D class.@
` I still didn't meet her, but according to my uncle, she belongs to the female volleyball club.@
` Last night she stayed up late and spotted some suspicious shadows near the school buildings.@
` That could be a great hint to solve the case.\
` I'm going to meet both of them and listen to their stories.@
` However, to be honest, the girl I'm more interested in is Ruriko.\
` I shared classrooms with her last year.@ She was literally a closeted maiden straight out from a novel.@
` A bishojo as beautiful as unapproachable, and the dream of every boy of the class.@ Needless to say, I never did so much as exchanging greetings with her.\
` But just this break, I talked for the first time with her.@
` That same unapproachable Ruriko talked to me first.@
` It's been a long time since the last time I saw her, and she has changed 180° from what I remember she was like.\
` The Ruriko I met in the rooftop seemed like a small girl before reaching maturity.@
` She was poking fun at me with denpa waves, radio reception and whatnot, all while chuckling.@
` Her noble and high-class image receded in favor of a kitten-like cuteness, and she had a mysterious charm around her.\
` I realized immediately...@
` She suffered from a mental illness, neurosis.@
` Her eyes when I met her at the rooftop were exactly like Ohta's.@ What her eyes reflected was not reality, but a world disconnected from it.\
` The eyes of a person who experienced psychological damage.@
` The eyes of someone who opened the door towards the world of insanity.@
` In that blank year I knew nothing about her, for whatever reason she opened the door to madness; the door that leads to a realm behind the real world.@
` Perhaps she has something to do with Ohta.@
` Compared to Ohta, Ruriko's symptoms are still light, but the fact that two persons presented mental issues in such a short time it's too much to be called a coincidence.\
` Perhaps I should meet Ruriko again and talk with her about this.\
` Ding-Dong-Ding-Dong!@
` The last bell rings putting an end to the classes of the day.\
` As students from other classrooms come to mine, the atmosphere becomes more rowdier than usual.@
` Some students are going to participate in club activities and others stay for supplementary lessons, while others go straight home.@

((#128:))
` "Haa... Haa... Haa..."@
` With Saori on my shoulder, I manage to run up to the hallway, but exhausted, I lay her on the floor.@
` She's still breathing hard.@
` Her face is as red as if she just finished running a marathon, and a bit of sweat drops from her forehead.\
` What the hell was that?!
` What was that flood of electricity running through my head?
` Was that discharge that made Saori like this?
` Did that drive her crazy just like it made my head go numb?
` "Saori, Saori!"@
` I shake Saori by her shoulders.@
` ...... They're slim.@
` I never knew her shoulders were THIS slender.@
` Saori slowly opens her eyelids and answers feebly:@
` "Y-Yuusuke..."\
` I don't know if she recognized me, but she jumps right into my chest as if she were afraid of something.@
` "T-That current...@ That electric current...@ I don't want to go through it ever again!"@
` She shakes her head vigorously as her slender shoulders quiver.@
` "I'm scared, Mom..."
` "S-Saori..."\
` Her cheerfulness, talkativeness, friendiness, the passion she had for volleyball...@
` Everything about her made me think she was a formidable girl.@
` However, after seeing how afraid she is of ghosts and her current, pitiable state, I realize that was only my own preconception.\
` To be honest, back in the rooftop I thought it wasn't like her to be SO scared of ghosts.@
` That was because I believed mistakenly she was strong-willed.@
` I thought she wasn't acting like her usual self.@
` I was pretty sure she was just a little scared and that she'd come back to her usual playfulness in no time.\
` I convinced myself she was a strong, confident girl.@
` However, this girl crying and trembling in my chest now is the opposite of the image I had of her.@ She's like a fragile, spoiled little child.@
` Her shoulders are so thin they could easily be broken apart just by applying a little of force.@
` Her flimsy arms cling to me desperately.@
` Her hair smells slightly like shampoo.@
` I finally come to realize...@
` that THIS is Saori's true self.\
` "Saori..."@
` I try to call her name as gently as I can.@
` "Don't worry.@ There's no current anymore."@
` Languidly, Saori directs her tearful eyes towards me.@
` "Yuu... Suke..."@
` "I'm telling you, you won't receive another shock like that."@
` "...For real?"@
` Saori answers with a feeble question.\
` "What we should be doing now is moving on.@ Can you stand up?"@
` "...Yes."@
` She nods and gets away from my chest.@
` She draws her knees up, raises her hips and tries to stand up.@
` However, her knees give up and she falls on her rear.@
` "Yuu... suke..."@
` Still with her bum stuck to the floor and her knees up, she turns her sobbing gaze towards me and calls my name faintly.\
` This may sound inappropriate, but I think she's very cute in this state.@
` I crouch and turn my back to her.@
` "Alright, I'll carry you on my back.@ Hop on."@
` "Yuusuke..."@
` Saori whispers my name and braces my shoulders with both arms.@
` I muster strenght and stand up, but since it's too much momentum, Saori loses balance after two or three steps.@ That's because, contrary to what I expected, she was as light as a feather.\
` I start to walk with Saori on my back.@
` She clings firmly to my back as she shivers.@
` I don't know what effect the current had on her, but I can tell she's WAY too scared.@
` Perhaps Saori was always a scaredy-cat?\
` I'm doing all what I can to restrain my fear before Saori, but just like her, I could break out shivering any moment now.@
` If I became agitated now, that would only make Saori all the more anxious.@
` I advance slowly without hurry.\
` Anyway, we have to escape where no one sees us.@
` Someone might come for us from the student council room.@
` I don't think those girls and Tsukishima would pose much of a threat, but I can't help but have a bad feeling about them.@
` That electric current, Ohta coming out of the hospital...@ It's all so weird.@
` I know I'm exaggerating, but perhaps my animal instinct warned me about a potential danger from them.\
` For now, I'll head to the second gym where Saori left her lugagge.@
` We'll hide there and rest for a while, and once Saori recovers, we'll get out from school.@
` After that, I'll call my uncle, report him everything I saw here, and forget everything about this incident.@
` I don't care what happens after.@
` Once I report the events, my work ends there.\
` Anyway, it's time to run away.@
` I'm gonna head to the second gym.\
` The empty gym at night is always deserted and flooded with yellow moonlight.@
` Carrying Saori on my back, I cross the entrance door made of hard glass and enter the building.@
` I open wide the door and set foot on the arena.@
` Golden moonlight sheds light inside the gym.@
` Only my wild breath echoes through the slightly dusty, chilly air.\
` We're pretty far from the student council.@
` It seems Saori's shivering has calmed down almost completely.@
` However, in exchange for that, the force she's clinging to me with has increased.@
` It's like she's pushing her whole self onto me.\
` Both of her soft breasts are pressing against my back.@
` Her warm breath blows upon my nape.@
` "S-Saori...@ I can't breathe."@
` "Ah!@ S-Sorry..."@
` With her face dyed red, she loosens her entire body.@
` "I-I'm just..."@
` "It's fine, don't sweat it.\
` However, after I give three steps forward, she presses herself against me again.@
` Her plump breasts, her warm breath, her silky thighs, her soft buttocks...@
` It has been only a while since I saw her in all her glory.@
` That's why that lower part of myself is reacting inevitably.@
` "......"@
` I lean forward so that she doesn't notice my red face and my lower half.\
` Is she so scared that she NEEDS to cling to me so badly?@
` No, this actually looks more like...@
` "Yuu... suke..."@
` Saori embraces me stronger than ever before.@
` I feel her arousing, sweet breath in my nape.@
` She looks exactly like those girls of the student council we met before.\
` "What's wrong, Saori?!"@
` "Ah, sorry!@ Umm, I..."@
` At that instant, she draws back immediately.@
` However, after a while, she starts clinging to me again, little by little.@
` She's just repeating the same actions from before.\
` "!"@
` Saori presses her pelvis against my hips.@
` I feel her soft and warm abdomen thoroughly.@
` "Nh...@ Fuh...@ Haa..."@
` Saori lets out a painful gasp.@
` "Saori!"@
` When I shout her name in a slightly loud voice, she suddenly realizes what she's doing and awkwardly recedes.@
` "I-It's not what you think!@ I.... I just...!"\
` As we talk, we reach the volleyball club's gym.@
` I open the door, enter, and close it again with the key so that nobody comes in.@
` The scent of wooden flooring drifts faintly in the air.@
` Only the moonlight illuminates the gym from the window.\
` Saori's school and sports bag remain alone on the floor, refreshingly tidied up.@
` "Let's rest here."@
` I sit Saori on a chair without backrest.@
` When she slides down from my back, our bodies touch each other.@
` "Haa!@ Nh!"@
` Saori lets out an erotic moan and shrinks her body.\
` "A-AHEM!"@
` I cough.@
` "......"@
` Saori looks at me with dampened eyes and cheeks flushed bright red.@
` She looks embarrassed, demanding, and anxious all at the same time.@ Her expression is as complex as it can get.@
` What in the world is wrong with her?\
` "Saori...@ How do you feel?"@
` I crouch in order to meet her gaze directly.@
` "Huh?!"@
` Saori exclaims in a hoarse, loud voice.@
` "Does your head hurt?"@
` "N-No...@ I think I'm fine already..."@
` "I see.@ That's good to hear."@
` "......"@
` Immediately after, she falls silent again and keeps staring at me.\
` "You can walk on your own now, right?@ Let's go home before they find us.@ I'll carry your bags."@
` I take both her school bag and her sport bag.@
` "We'd better get out of here as soon as possible.@ C'mon, let's go."@
` I stand before the entrance and open it with the key.@ However...@
` "Saori?"@
` For some reason, Saori doesn't show any will to get up.\
` She just keeps gazing at me from the chair as she braces herself weakly.@
` I notice she's quivering.@
` "What is it?@ Are you still afraid?"@
` Still standing in front of the door, I leave the bags on the floor at my feet and approach Saori.\
` "N-No!"@
` Saori's body stiffens up all of a sudden.@
` I stop on my tracks.@
` "W-What's wrong?"@
` "No!@ Don't come!"@
` Her cheeks furious red, Saori screams on the verge of tears.\
` I hesitate for a bit, but finally decide to approach Saori anyway.@
` We'll get nowhere like this.@
` She looks a lot better than before, so we should focus on leaving the school urgently.@
` "D-Don't come near me, please!"@
` "What's the problem?@ I don't get it."@
` Turning a deaf ear to her pleads, I keep getting closer to her.\
` Saori's gazing at me like she's looking at something scary.@
` "C'mon, let's go home."@
` I try to grab her arm, but then...\
` "No!@ Get away!"@
` *THUD!*@
` Saori pushes me away with both palms.@
` Her thrust was forceful, but not very powerful.@ She only pushed me half a step away.@
` "Saori?!"@
` She looks like she's about to cry.@
` "Why...?"\
` Just then, I notice a shining liquid dripping from the zone of her butt.@
` "Saori...?"@
` "Ah!"@
` Presuming right away that I noticed it, Saori covers her face in embarrassment and hides her crotch awkwardly pushing down her skirt.@
` Instead of hiding it, that only makes it all the more evident.\
` *Psssh*@
` Doing wet sounds, several lewd, bright drops flow through her thighs.@
` "Ah!@ Aaah..."@
` At first I thought she peed herself.@
` However, that doesn't seem to be the case.@
` That sticky, overflowing fluid is clearly not urine.\
` It's love juice.@
` The liquid that girls secrete when they're sexually aroused.@
` That fluid is gleaming under the moonlight.@
` As viscous love juice leaks across her thighs, Saori trembles while she looks at me fixedly and braces herself.\
` "S-Saori..."@
` In an attempt to break this awkward silence, I call her name.@
` *Twitch!*@
` Her body twitches as she reacts surprised to my voice, and she falls from the chair.\
` "Kyaaa!"@
` She lets out a short cry and falls on her rear.@ From the inside of her skirt, a different fluid from before spreads across her thighs.@
` "Ah...@ Aaah...@ D-Don't look..."@
` White steam rises up from the liquid.\
` Saori bites her lip and covers her bright-red face, and then, she breaks down crying.@
` This time I have no doubt...@
` She peed herself.@
` Unable to stand the nervousness, Saori suffered incontinence the moment she fell from the chair.\
` Faint moonlight rays shine from the window.@
` The stench of urine fills the volleyball's club room filled with cold air.@
` In this quiet gym at night, no one's here aside from us.@
` Amidst this dim room, only Saori's low weeping resonates.\
` "*Snif* *Snif*..."@
` Still bum to the floor, Saori covers her face as she wipes the tears dripping from her eyes.@
` It wasn't my intention to scare her this much...@
` No, perhaps she was holding her pee all this time.@
` Maybe that's why she was acting so strange.\
` What should I say to her?@
` "*Sob* *Sob*..."@
` She keeps crying as her shoulder trembles, just like a little child.\
` "I-I'm going out."@
` I decide to leave the room for a while.@
` I'll only make things more awkward if I stay here, so that will be better for Saori.@
` I turn around trying not to look in Saori's direction, and walk towards the door.\
` "W-Wait...@ Don't go."@
` Saori stops me with a shaking voice.@
` "I'm not going anywhere.@ I'll only stay at the other side of the door."@
` "No...@ Don't leave me alone..."@
` Saori says, sobbing mixed in her weeping voice.\
` "I thought it'd be difficult for you to change if I'm here..."@
` "I'm begging you...@ Don't go..."@
` "Saori..."@
` "Stay here...@ Please..."@
` Saori repeats the same words again and again.\
` "Fine, I'll stay here."@
` "*Hic* *Hic*..."@
` She looks totally like a small kid.@
` "Well, I'll be looking to this side, so you can change now.@ You brought your P.E uniform with you, right?"@
` "*Sob* *Sob*..."@
` All I hear from her is sobbing, and not any answer.\
` Despite I wait for a while, Saori doesn't try to get up.@
` I give her a fleeting glimpse.@
` She's still stuck to the floor as tears keep dripping from her big eyes.@
` "What's wrong, Saori?@ You can't change clothes?"@
` I ask her with my back turned to her.\
` "*Snif* *Snif*..."@
` After crying for a good while, she finally holds her tears and says in a low voice:@
` "*Sob*...@ I lost...@ strenght...@ in my legs..."@
` "Huh?@ Y-You can't stand up?"@
` "It seems I can't..."@
` She explains to me, and she's about to cry once more.\
` She can't stand up?@
` Why?@
` Did the fear make her legs weak?@
` Or it's because that mysterious electric current from before?\
` What should I do...?\
` I don't know how to proceed.@ What should I do for Saori now?@
` She's so pitiable that I can't leave her alone, but I can't change her myself either.@
` Also, I feel it's dangerous to stay here for too long.@
` And worst of all, at this rate Saori's gonna catch a cold...\
` What do I do...?
` What the hell should I do...?\
