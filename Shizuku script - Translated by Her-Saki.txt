((#001:))
` *Click! Click!*@ I stretch the lead of my mechanical pencil again and again as I let it run meaninglessly through my notebook, until eventually, the lead breaks apart and some specks hit my cheek.\
` The sluggish wind swaying the beige curtains makes this class feel even more like a silent, colorless film shot in a faraway world.\
` Inside the classroom lighted by the western sun, the dead-eyed students write down rows upon rows of characters in their notebooks as they gulp in great lungfuls of chalk dust.\
` As weird as it may sound, these recent days I feel like time is advancing in a MUDDY way.@
` As if every day the same film is projected at exactly the same time...@ It's a strange feeling indeed.\
` A repetitive, invariable, futile routine.\
` At some point in time which I'm unable to specify, all the color and sound of this dull world vanished.\
` However, I'm not really affected by it.@ Instead, I embrace this indescribable heat inside me and, as usual, forget myself writing scribbles in my notebook.\
` I let my pencil run silently across the notebook, and draw a circle in a page of my brand-new college notebook, filled with blue ruled lines.@ It's the same circle I'm used to draw every day.@
((#002:))
` This way, I immerse myself in my own wet, sticky dreamworld...\
` The circle represents the Earth.@
` Since I created it, it is only mine.\
` Unfortunately, this Earth of mine I drew will have to be destroyed.@ It's a 1:1 miniature of the Earth where we're all living now.@
` The polluted sky and oceans, the garbage dump-like cities, and the social structure designed for enslaved, lifeless people are exactly like our world.\
` The apocalypse always comes when you least expect it.@
` I draw small circles around the main circle.@ These are explosions from a new type of nuke that burn and destroy everything.@
` All of a sudden, an explosion occurs without warning.@
` The earth splits and cracks, the sky rampages, and flames erupt creating a burning hell.@
` Their fingers and earlobes blown away, people run from the flames aimlessly.@ They escape without knowing what the hell happened to Earth so out of the blue.\
` My apocalyptic fantasy doesn't stop there.\
` However, there's nowhere to escape.@ It's impossible, because the Earth itself is falling apart and is about to disappear.@
` Despite they run so desperately their legs are torn off, and so fast their lungs burn out, there's just no way they can escape from the end of the world.\
` In an automatic motion, I keep drawing more and more circles.@ The places where the nukes explode meet a gruesome, ultimate destruction.@
` As people gradually lose their own world, they kick each other to make way and crawl around the surface looking to shelter themselves.\
` I leave a single safe place on purpose while the rest of the world is being engulfed by flames.@
` After trampling down on others in order to survive, those ugly, pathetic creatures called humans group there to save their lives.@
` As they breathe out poisonous gas from their almost rotten mouths, every single one of them start pleading for mercy.@
` "Please save us!"
` "Why are we being punished?!"\
` I slowly lift my right arm as if teasing them, and as I hear their desperate appeals and screams, I mercilessly draw the last nuke.\
` At that very moment, I feel like I'm actually hearing the screams of millions of people at once.@
` I feel an intense rush of blood through my whole body.\
` This unspeakable excitement makes me feel agitated.@
` Once I wake up from my fantasy, I slowly let go of my pencil and I'm astonished to notice my palm is sweating A LOT.\
((#003:))
` Every time I'm struck with these vivid delusions during the day, I feel shivers fierce enough to make my hair stand on end.@
` However, I can't deny I feel a bit of guilty pleasure when the blood pumps through my veins.\
` During class, there's a part of me that enjoys intoxicating itself with drug-like fantasies, and a part of me that fears the other one.@
` Those wild dreams become more lifelike and realistic every day, and at the same time, the real world becomes more dull and soundless.
` Blazing, blood-pounding insanity on one side, and dry, withered rationality on the other.\
` Perhaps I'm getting far away from this boring reality as I tread little by little into the world of madness...\
((#004:))
` Thinking about that, I let my gaze wander through space, and then...\
` "Huhuhuhu..."@
` I hear a dry laugh echoing through the classroom.@
` Strangely, despite that laugh should be soundless to me, I can hear it loud and clear.@
` "Huhuhuhu..."@
` The students stop writing in their notebooks and turn their heads to that creepy laugh.\
` The student laughing is a girl that sits diagonally to me.@
` Obviously, I know her face.@ However, I can't recall her name.\
` She gazes absent-mindedly outside the window, and despite the teacher didn't even call out to her, she slowly stands up, all while chuckling.@
` As she's illuminated by the western sun, her silhouette is projected in the wall before her, just like a faint shadow picture.\
` "What's wrong, Ohta?"@
` The teacher that was writing rows of characters akin to worms crawling across the blackboard stops his hand holding the chalk.@
` Ohta...@ Yeah, she's Ohta.@ She's one of the student council's board members, and she's always surrounded by a group of girls.@
` "Huhu, huhuhu...@ Haha, hahahahahahaha..."@
` Her giggles turn into a loud laughter, and still facing to the window, she keeps laughing joyfully.\
` The class looks at her a bit spooked.@
` "Hey, what's wrong with Kanako?"@
` "She creeps me out..."@
` The students' whispers mix with Ohta's chuckles.\
` Then, Ohta strikes her desk full-force with both hands.@
` All of a sudden, the classroom becomes dead silent.@
` Before the perplexed stare of the students, she mutters a single word in a low voice:@
` "Sex."\
` After a brief moment, the entire classroom burst into laughter.@
` "Hahahahahahaha!@ That was nasty, Kanako, but really funny!"@
` "Huahahahaha!@ What the fuck, Ohta?!@ You horny or somethin'?!"@
` Without paying attention to the desperate efforts of the teacher to calm things down, the students' hysterical laughter pierces the air and resounds through the classroom.\
` "Huhu, huhuhu.@ Gimme some, c'mon.@ Gimme some dick.@ I can't take it anymore.@ C'mon, be cool.@ I want a dick.@ You hear me?@ A DICK!@ I wanna a dick!@ Put it inside me!@ Thrust it into my hot, wet, drenched pussy!@ I wanna have sex, right here, right now!@ I wanna do iiit...!@ I WANNA FUUUUUCK!!@ Sex, sex, sex, sex, sex SEX SEX SEX SEX SEX SEX SEX SEX SEX SEX SEX SEX...!!"\
` The students' laughs gradually fade out.@
` Just like a broken CD player, she repeats the word "Sex" endlessly.@
` Now, not a single student is laughing anymore.@
` It's clear to everyone that Ohta's not in her right mind.\
` "KYAAAAAAAAAAAH!!"@
` At that moment, a girl's scream breaks apart the desolate atmosphere of the classroom.@
` The students watch the scene with their breath taken away.@
` Ohta tears out her own face scratching it with her nails, and as a result, both of her hands become red with blood.\
` The teacher that was watching dumbfounded comes to his senses and rushes over to Ohta.@
` He holds down her hands, but it's too late.@ Both her face and her uniform are already dyed bright red with blood, a vivid hue that reminds me of tomato juice.@
` Amidst an eerie silence, an abnormal nervousness overwhelms the students.\
` Immediately, two boys along with the teacher holding her down take Ohta, who is competely covered by blood, to the infirmary.\
` After Ohta and the others leave the classroom, the noise resumes and the students begin to make a fuss again, as if they cut a tense thread hanging over them.@
` Every single of the students was creeped out by her sudden self-harming attack.@
` However, as for me...@ I know it's strange, but I felt an indescribable affinity towards her.@
` That's right...@ She entered the realm of madness a bit earlier than me.@ Perhaps that's the reason.@
` After seeing that puddle of bright red blood inside the classroom illuminated by the western sun, bit by bit, reality started to gain color again.\
` Before long, I hear the distant sound of an ambulance coming closer.\
((#005:))
` It's been three days since Ohta's incident.@
` Out of the blue, she lost her mind and began to scratch her own face until turning it into a bloody pulp.\
` According to her family and friends' testimonies, she behaved completely normal before that day.@
` However, she went crazy specifically in the day of the accident.\
` "Y'know?@ The other day I tried to talk with her like usual, and Kanako turned her face slowly with a creeeeepy smile.@
` I kid you not, that was DISGUSTING!@ It was exactly like the face of a ghost I saw in a TV show the other day.@ Maybe by then she had already gone bonkers, who knows?"\
` Naturally, Ohta became the trending topic of every classroom for the next two days after the incident.@
` They say she was hospitalized in a general hospital in order to operate her, and that she'll be transferred to a psychiatric ward next week.@
` People's also spreading careless rumors about the source of her insanity.@
` That she was always neurotic, that she did drugs...@
` There's even a theory according to which her boyfriend cheated on her and she was left so traumatized that wanted someone to rape her.\
` However, as anybody would expect, three days later people got tired of that topic and established a sort of weird "pact of silence", so Ohta's incident became a taboo issue.\
` Until yesterday's afternoon everyone was talking excitedly about Ohta, but as soon as someone suggested making a pact of silence, they immediately turned tails.@
` I think every single of them are coward sheeps.@ They act according to other people's reactions, and instead of holding their own opinion, they follow blindly whatever trash the mass believes.@ They're really stupid.\
` That's why, despite she lost her mind, I can't help but relate to Ohta.\
((#006:))
` Uncommonly, today's break my uncle asked me to come to the teachers' office.\
` My uncle is my father's second little brother.@ He's a contemporary Japanese language teacher that works in this school.@
` Despite he's from my family, we aren't very close.@
` When I was a kid he used to visit my father and me regularly, but in these last ten years he never showed up if not for big family reunions, and as far as personal meeting goes, we had none.@
` We often pass by each other in the hallway, but we only exchange a polite smile or greeting, and that's where our bond ends.\
` Moreover, having a relative teaching in one's school can get pretty... annoying.@
` Not only he doesn't let me know the exams' content beforehand and whatnot, but he leaks secrets about my school life to my parents and vice versa.@
` To make matters worse, despite we treat each other as family, we have to act as a teacher and student in the face of society, which results in awkward situations.@ I find that really irritating.\
` I try to avoid him as much as I can.@
` He knows I find it difficult to deal with our relationship, so he doesn't contact me regularly either.\
` That's why is so rare of him to call me to the staff room.\
` Once I reach the office, I do a small, polite nod, and enter through the door.@
` I look around for my uncle.@
` "Oh, Yuusuke.@ I'm here."@
` When I turn my gaze to the voice, I find my uncle behind a pile of textbooks.@
` As I approach him, he leaves the teacup in his desk and gets up from his chair.@
` "Come to the rooftop."@
` He says patting my shoulder.\
` Carried by him, he takes me up to the rooftop.@
` The mild sunlight and somewhat chilly wind feel refreshing.@ I look out over to observe in a sweep the urban landscape that surrounds the school.\
((#007:))
` "What can I help you with?"@
` I break the ice first.@ Honestly, I think the tone of my speech is not very "familiar".@ Perhaps I should have said "What's the matter?" instead.@
` My uncle takes out a cigarette from his pocket without haste, and lights it with a 100 yen lighter as he covers it from the wind with his hands.@ He inhales the smoke as if he's taking a deep breath, and takes his time to exhale.@
` "Lately the office banned smoking indoors.@ It's hella maddening."@
` Before this unimportant topic he brings up, I only answer "I see".\
` "They say smokers damage non smokers's health and shit.@ They even went as far as declaring it a violation of human rights.@ Now, I'd like to ask them, what about the smokers' human rights, huh?@"
` This sounds pretty egotistical, but I guess that's yet another of my uncle's jokes.\
` "That said, I understand we teachers are disreputable as life guides when we drill in your heads "don't smoke, don't smoke" and then we smoke like chimneys in the office."@
` "Uncle, what did you want to talk about...?"@
` His soliloquy never ends, so I cut the chase.@
` "Nh?@ Oh, yeah..."@
` He throws the cigarette he just lit a moment ago to the floor and steps on it to put out the fire.@ Then...@
` "You got a real surprise on Monday, don't you?"@
` He says out of the blue.\
` "Monday?@ You mean Ohta's incident?"@
` "She's from your class, right?"@
` "Yes, she sits diagonally to me."@
` "Were you friends with that girl?"@
` "No, not really..."\
` I answer unconcernedly as if I were being questioned by a police officer.\
` "She's from your class, so I take you know a lot about her, don't you?"@
` "Know what?"@
` "Rumors and such."@
` "Yes, I heard all sort of things about her, but those rumors were all groundless."@
` "What "things", specifically?"@
` My uncle peeks into my eyes.@
` "For example..."@
` 1. That she was neurotic from the beginning.
` 2. That she consumed illicit substances.
((#008:))
` "I heard that she was neurotic all along."
` "Yeah, that sounds credible."@
` My uncle smiles awkwardly.@
` "From a layman's point of view, one would normally associate a student's mental breakdown with nervous disorders caused by stress, meaning, neurosis.@ Under that perspective, the origin of her insanity could be traced back to problems in her daily life.@ The press in particular tends to emphasize that line of thought.@ They'd argue she was likely a victim of bullying at school, and that the school's management was greatly at fault..."\
` Unintentionally, I picture crazy-driven Ohta in my mind.@
` She was a top member of the student council.@ If I recall correctly, the vice president.@
` She was bright, optimistic, and was always surrounded by a bunch of girls.@ She had a lot of friends, too.@ It's like she lived a in different world than me.\
` "Ohta had nothing to do with bullying, stress or anything of the sort.@ I don't believe she suffered from neurosis."@
` Without even realizing it, I find myself defending her like a lawyer.@ That's probably due to the closeness I feel towards her.@
` "Exactly.@ After investigating a bit, I found nothing in her domestic or school life that could potentially trigger neurosis.@ She was doing well at school, and she had almost no troubles family-wise.@ That's why we're looking for the main cause in other aspects of her life."@
` "Does that mean you have ruled out the possibility of family and school issues?"@
` "Yeah, pretty much.@ I'm only making conjectures, though.@ I have the strong suspicion that were other factors involved.@ What other rumors did you hear?"@
((#009:))
` "They say she consumed illicit substances."@
` "Hmm, judging by the state she was on Monday, she showed all the typical symptoms of a drug addict."@
` "So she was doing drugs, after all?"@
` Unintentionally, I furrow my brows.\
` "No, we only suspected that."@
` My uncle coughs.@
` "In psychatry, psychosis are classified into several categories.@ Alcoholic psychosis, organic psychosis, and of course drug psychosis."@
` "I see..."\
` "And obviously we had a doctor examine her."@
` "What was the diagnosis?"@
` My uncle drops his head slowly.@
` "According to the check-up they ran at the hospital...@ Oh, by the way, she's still hospitalized in a general hospital, but they didn't find a single trace of substances inside her body."@
` "Then the cause lies in another place entirely, right?@ Perhaps she was cornered by a problem her family and friends never knew about."@
` "That's plausible.@ Mental issues are a thing from the mind, though, so we can't take any conclusions as unconditionally true.@ Just because her breakdown happened AFTER a certain incident that doesn't mean the cause was THAT incident.@ Perhaps said event was only the last straw that broke her, and the actual source of the problem was always rooted inside her as potential neurosis."@
` "That said, if we keep following that line of thought we'd only be walking in circles forever, so we focus the investigation on what we actually CAN investigate.@ Anyway, what other rumors did you hear?"@
` He asks me, and I try to recall any other gossips.\
((#010:))
` "Did you call me to help you theorize about this?"@
` "No, there's actually another reason but, c'mon, keep me company a little more.@ Now, tell me, any other rumors you have heard of?"@
` "That she was dumped by her boyfriend, and..."@
` "That she was raped?"@
` It was hard for me to say that, but my uncle spat it out without hesitation.\
` "Yes, there's a theory about a possible sexual assault."@
` "Actually, I think that's where her insanity stems from.@ You share classroom with her, so I'm pretty sure you heard what Ohta screamed as she tore apart her own face."@
` As my uncle tells me that, I picture vividly what happened that day in my mind.\
` That day, Ohta was chuckling while looking outside the window, and then she started to shout dirty words as if she were possessed by a demon.@
` She straight up asked for sex.@ Since Ohta stands out so much among our class, boys reacted inevitably in an oversensitive manner.@
` Judging by her speech, it's possible that the root of her madness has some kind of relation with sex.@
` I think that's what my uncle is trying to say.\
` "Well, I'm only telling you this because it's you, but she already had sexual experience with men.@ It seems she had sex the day previous to the incident."@
` "How do you know that?"@
` "The results of her medical check-up."@
` "Did they go that far...?"@
` I picture Ohta inside a white-walled hospital room as a bunch of unknown doctors examine her intimate zone.@ It feels somewhat revolting.\
` "So you're narrowing down the source of her mental issues to problems with men?"@
` "Yeah."@
` My uncle takes out another cigarette from his breast pocket, puts it into his mouth, and lights it.@ After inhaling the smoke with a deep breath, he points his gaze at the urban landscape beyond the fence.\
` "Ohta's parents said she recently (though we're only talking about two weeks prior to the incident) started to get out frequently by night."@
` Cigarette smoke rises from my uncle's mouth.@
` "Perhaps she went to her boyfriend's house."@
` "No, it seems that's not the case."@
` He directs his gaze to me and curls slightly his lips.\
` "It looks like she came here, to the school, by night.@ Perhaps this part will be nasty to hear, but that's what she wrote in her diary."@
` "So the school investigated even her diary just like the police would do?"@
` "Don't be like that.@ That was also a request from Ohta's parents, and..."@
` "And what?"@
` "If we're not careful, this incident could escalate into a criminal case."\
((#011:))
` "In her diary they found..."@
` My uncle cuts himself short.@
` "It's bizarre.@ She started writing in it three weeks ago.@ It seems she had to come to the school for some reason and she began to write since that day.@ Most pages of the notebook are blank."\
` "What are the contents of the diary?"@
` He shakes his head slightly, exhales a puff of smoke, and simply says "nothing".\
` "It only says "I went to school".@ That's it."\
` 21/2 - Tonight I'm going to school.\
` 22/2 - Tonight I'm going to school.\
` "And so on and so forth.@ Rather than a diary, it feels more like she was keeping track of the days she went to school."@
` "She jotted down those notes before leaving home, right?"@
` "Yeah.@ I don't know why, but I assume she wanted to leave a record that she actually came."@
` "Did she write down her reasons for coming?"@
` "Unfortunately no, she didn't.@ But I don't think she'd came without a good reason."@
` My uncle smiles awkwardly as if he said "well, duh", and gulps in a good lungful of smoke.\
` The wind blows away the cigarette smoke he breathes out and it tickles my nose.@
` "However..."@
` Taking me by surprise, my uncle resumes his explanation out of the blue.@ He has a serious look on his face.@
` "This was written on Sunday, the day prior to the incident."\
` My uncle takes out a piece of paper from his pocket and hands it over to me.@
` "I copied it from her diary."\
` 2/3 - Today I'm not going to school.@ Despite it's Sunday, third year teachers presented themselves at work.@ They'll stay at office until late night, so today I won't go."@
` I can't stand it.@
` I can't stand it.@
` How can the other girls endure this?!@
` I'm going straight to his home.\
` "What do you think about this, Yuusuke?"@
` ""What"?@ I'm not a detective, you know?"@
` "Laymans' opinions can be helpful, too."\
` Without even realizing it, I feel like my uncle is tangling me up more and more in this case.@
` He said this incident could escalate to a criminal case, right?@
((#128:))
` "Haa... Haa... Haa..."@
` With Saori on my shoulder, I manage to run up the hallway, but exhausted, I lay her on the floor.@
` She's still breathing hard.
` Her face is as red as if she just finished running a marathon, and a bit of sweat drops from her forehead.\
` What the hell was that?!
` What was that flood of electricity running through my head?
` Was that discharge that made Saori like this?
` Did that drive her crazy just like it made my head go numb?
` "Saori, Saori!"@
` I shake Saori by her shoulders.@
` ...... They're slim.@
` I never knew her shoulders were THIS slender.@
` Saori slowly opens her eyelids and answers feebly:@
` "Y-Yuusuke..."\
` I don't know if she recognized me, but she jumps right into my chest as if she were afraid of something.@
` "T-That current...@ That electric current...@ I don't want to go through it ever again!"@
` She shakes her head vigorously as her slender shoulders quiver.@
` "I'm scared, Mom..."
` "S-Saori..."\
` Her cheerfulness, talkativeness, friendiness, the passion she had for volleyball...@
` Everything about her made me think she was a formidable girl.@
` However, after seeing how afraid she is of ghosts and her current, pitiable state, I realize that was only my own preconception.\
` To be honest, back in the rooftop I thought it wasn't like her to be SO scared of ghosts.@
` That was because I believed mistakenly she was strong-willed.@
` I thought she wasn't acting like her usual self.@
` I was pretty sure she was just a little scared and that she'd come back to her usual playfulness in no time.\
` I convinced myself she was a strong, confident girl.@
` However, this girl crying and trembling in my chest now is the opposite of the image I had of her.@ She's like a fragile, spoiled little child.@
` Her shoulders are so thin they could easily be broken apart just by applying a little of force.@
` Her flimsy arms cling to me desperately.@
` Her hair smells slightly like shampoo.@
` I finally come to realize...@
` that THIS is Saori's true self.\
` "Saori..."@
` I try to call her name as gently as I can.@
` "Don't worry.@ There's no current anymore."@
` Languidly, Saori directs her tearful eyes towards me.@
` "Yuu... Suke..."@
` "I'm telling you, you won't receive another shock like that."@
` "...For real?"@
` Saori answers with a feeble question.\
` "What we should be doing now is moving on.@ Can you stand up?"@
` "...Yes."@
` She nods and gets away from my chest.@
` She draws her knees up, raises her hips and tries to stand up.@
` However, her knees give up and she falls on her rear.@
` "Yuu... suke..."@
` Still with her bum stuck to the floor and her knees up, she turns her sobbing gaze towards me and calls my name faintly.\
` This may sound inappropriate, but I think she's very cute in this state.@
` I crouch and turn my back to her.@
` "Alright, I'll carry you on my back.@ Hop on."@
` "Yuusuke..."@
` Saori whispers my name and braces my shoulders with both arms.@
` I muster strenght and stand up, but since it's too much momentum, Saori loses balance after two or three steps.@ That's because, contrary to what I expected, she was as light as a feather.\
` I start to walk with Saori on my back.@
` She clings firmly to my back as she shivers.@
` I don't know what effect the current had on her, but I can tell she's WAY too scared.@
` Perhaps Saori was always a scaredy-cat?\
` I'm doing all what I can to restrain my fear before Saori, but just like her, I could break out shivering any moment now.@
` If I became agitated now, that would only make Saori all the more anxious.@
` I advance slowly without hurry.\
` Anyway, we have to escape where no one sees us.@
` Someone might come for us from the student council room.@
` I don't think those girls and Tsukishima would pose much of a threat, but I can't help but have a bad feeling about them.@
` That electric current, Ohta coming out of the hospital...@ It's all so weird.@
` I know I'm exaggerating, but perhaps my animal instinct warned me about a potential danger from them.\
` For now, I'll head to the second gym where Saori left her lugagge.@
` We'll hide there and rest for a while, and once Saori recovers, we'll get out from school.@
` After that, I'll call my uncle, report him everything I saw here, and forget everything about this incident.@
` I don't care what happens after.@
` Once I report the events, my work ends there.\
` Anyway, it's time to run away.@
` I'm gonna head to the second gym.\
` The empty gym at night is always deserted and flooded with yellow moonlight.@
` Carrying Saori on my back, I cross the entrance door made of hard glass and enter the building.@
` I open wide the door and set foot on the arena.@
` Golden moonlight sheds light inside the gym.@
` Only my wild breath echoes through the slightly dusty, chilly air.\
` We're pretty far from the student council.@
` It seems Saori's shivering has calmed down almost completely.@
` However, in exchange for that, the force she's clinging to me with has increased.@
` It's like she's pushing her whole self onto me.\
` Both of her soft breasts are pressing against my back.@
` Her warm breath blows upon my nape.@
` "S-Saori...@ I can't breathe."@
` "Ah!@ S-Sorry..."@
` With her face dyed red, she loosens her entire body.@
` "I-I'm just..."@
` "It's fine, don't sweat it.\
` However, after I give three steps forward, she presses herself against me again.@
` Her plump breasts, her warm breath, her silky thighs, her soft buttocks...@
` It has been only a while since I saw her in all her glory.@
` That's why that lower part of myself is reacting inevitably.@
` "......"@
` I lean forward so that she doesn't notice my red face and my lower half.\
` Is she so scared that she NEEDS to cling to me so badly?@
` No, this actually looks more like...@
` "Yuu... suke..."@
` Saori embraces me stronger than ever before.@
` I feel her arousing, sweet breath in my nape.@
` She looks exactly like those girls of the student council we met before.\
` "What's wrong, Saori?!"@
` "Ah, sorry!@ Umm, I..."@
` At that instant, she draws back immediately.@
` However, after a while, she starts clinging to me again, little by little.@
` She's just repeating the same actions from before.\
` "!"@
` Saori presses her pelvis against my hips.@
` I feel her soft and warm abdomen thoroughly.@
` "Nh...@ Fuh...@ Haa..."@
` Saori lets out a painful gasp.@
` "Saori!"@
` When I shout her name in a slightly loud voice, she suddenly realizes what she's doing and awkwardly recedes.@
` "I-It's not what you think!@ I.... I just...!"\
` As we talk, we reach the volleyball club's gym.@
` I open the door, enter, and close it again with the key so that nobody comes in.@
` The scent of wooden flooring drifts faintly in the air.@
` Only the moonlight illuminates the gym from the window.\
` Saori's school and sports bag remain alone on the floor, refreshingly tidied up.@
` "Let's rest here."@
` I sit Saori on a chair without backrest.@
` When she slides down from my back, our bodies touch each other.@
` "Haa!@ Nh!"@
` Saori lets out an erotic moan and shrinks her body.\
` "A-AHEM!"@
` I cough.@
` "......"@
` Saori looks at me with dampened eyes and cheeks flushed bright red.@
` She looks embarrassed, demanding, and anxious all at the same time.@ Her expression is as complex as it can get.@
` What in the world is wrong with her?\
` "Saori...@ How do you feel?"@
` I crouch in order to meet her gaze directly.@
` "Huh?!"@
` Saori exclaims in a hoarse, loud voice.@
` "Does your head hurt?"@
` "N-No...@ I think I'm fine already..."@
` "I see.@ That's good to hear."@
` "......"@
` Immediately after, she falls silent again and keeps staring at me.\
` "You can walk on your own now, right?@ Let's go home before they find us.@ I'll carry your bags."@
` I take both her school bag and her sport bag.@
` "We'd better get out of here as soon as possible.@ C'mon, let's go."@
` I stand before the entrance and open it with the key.@ However...@
` "Saori?"@
` For some reason, Saori doesn't show any will to get up.\
` She just keeps gazing at me from the chair as she braces herself weakly.@
` I notice she's quivering.@
` "What is it?@ Are you still afraid?"@
` Still standing in front of the door, I leave the bags on the floor at my feet and approach Saori.\
` "N-No!"@
` Saori's body stiffens up all of a sudden.@
` I stop on my tracks.@
` "W-What's wrong?"@
` "No!@ Don't come!"@
` Her cheeks furious red, Saori screams on the verge of tears.\
` I hesitate for a bit, but finally decide to approach Saori anyway.@
` We'll get nowhere like this.@
` She looks a lot better than before, so we should focus on leaving the school urgently.@
` "D-Don't come near me, please!"@
` "What's the problem?@ I don't get it."@
` Turning a deaf ear to her pleads, I keep getting closer to her.\
` Saori's gazing at me like she's looking at something scary.@
` "C'mon, let's go home."@
` I try to grab her arm, but then...\
` "No!@ Get away!"@
` *THUD!*@
` Saori pushes me away with both palms.@
` Her thrust was forceful, but not very powerful.@ She only pushed me half a step away.@
` "Saori?!"@
` She looks like she's about to cry.@
` "Why...?"\
` Just then, I notice a shining liquid dripping from the zone of her butt.@
` "Saori...?"@
` "Ah!"@
` Presuming right away that I noticed it, Saori covers her face in embarrassment and hides her crotch awkwardly pushing down her skirt.@
` Instead of hiding it, that only makes it all the more evident.\
` *Psssh*@
` Doing wet sounds, several lewd, bright drops flow through her thighs.@
` "Ah!@ Aaah..."@
` At first I thought she peed herself.@
` However, that doesn't seem to be the case.@
` That sticky, overflowing fluid is clearly not urine.\
` It's love juice.@
` The liquid that girls secrete when they're sexually aroused.@
` That fluid is gleaming under the moonlight.@
` As viscous love juice leaks across her thighs, Saori trembles while she looks at me fixedly and braces herself.\
` "S-Saori..."@
` In an attempt to break this awkward silence, I call her name.@
` *Twitch!*@
` Her body twitches as she reacts surprised to my voice, and she falls from the chair.\
` "Kyaaa!"@
` She lets out a short cry and falls on her rear.@ From the inside of her skirt, a different fluid from before spreads across her thighs.@
` "Ah...@ Aaah...@ D-Don't look..."@
` White steam rises up from the liquid.\
` Saori bites her lip and covers her bright-red face, and then, she breaks down crying.@
` This time I have no doubt...@
` She peed herself.@
` Unable to stand the nervousness, Saori suffered incontinence the moment she fell from the chair.\
` Faint moonlight rays shine from the window.@
` The stench of urine fills the volleyball's club room filled with cold air.@
` In this quiet gym at night, no one's here aside from us.@
` Amidst this dim room, only Saori's low weeping resonates.\
` "*Snif* *Snif*..."@
` Still bum to the floor, Saori covers her face as she wipes the tears dripping from her eyes.@
` It wasn't my intention to scare her this much...@
` No, perhaps she was holding her pee all this time.@
` Maybe that's why she was acting so strange.\
` What should I say to her?@
` "*Sob* *Sob*..."@
` She keeps crying as her shoulder trembles, just like a little child.\
` "I-I'm going out."@
` I decide to leave the room for a while.@
` I'll only make things more awkward if I stay here, so that will be better for Saori.@
` I turn around trying not to look in Saori's direction, and walk towards the door.\
` "W-Wait...@ Don't go."@
` Saori stops me with a shaking voice.@
` "I'm not going anywhere.@ I'll only stay at the other side of the door."@
` "No...@ Don't leave me alone..."@
` Saori says, sobbing mixed in her weeping voice.\
` "I thought it'd be difficult for you to change if I'm here..."@
` "I'm begging you...@ Don't go..."@
` "Saori..."@
` "Stay here...@ Please..."@
` Saori repeats the same words again and again.\
` "Fine, I'll stay here."@
` "*Hic* *Hic*..."@
` She looks totally like a small kid.@
` "Well, I'll be looking to this side, so you can change now.@ You brought your P.E uniform with you, right?"@
` "*Sob* *Sob*..."@
` All I hear from her is sobbing, and not any answer.\
` Despite I wait for a while, Saori doesn't try to get up.@
` I give her a fleeting glimpse.@
` She's still stuck to the floor as tears keep dripping from her big eyes.@
` "What's wrong, Saori?@ You can't change clothes?"@
` I ask her with my back turned to her.\
` "*Snif* *Snif*..."@
` After crying for a good while, she finally holds her tears and says in a low voice:@
` "*Sob*...@ I lost...@ strenght...@ in my legs..."@
` "Huh?@ Y-You can't stand up?"@
` "It seems I can't..."@
` She explains to me, and she's about to cry once more.\
` She can't stand up?@
` Why?@
` Did the fear make her legs weak?@
` Or it's because that mysterious electric current from before?\
` What should I do...?\
` I don't know how to proceed.@ What should I do for Saori now?@
` She's so pitiable that I can't leave her alone, but I can't change her myself either.@
` Also, I feel it's dangerous to stay here for too long.@
` And worst of all, at this rate Saori's gonna catch a cold...\
` What do I do...?
` What the hell should I do...?\
