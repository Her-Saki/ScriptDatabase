Shizuku - Translated by Her-Saki
((001:))
` *Click! Click!*@ I stretch the lead of my mechanical pencil again and again as I let it run meaninglessly through my notebook, until eventually, the lead breaks apart and some specks hit my cheek.\
` The sluggish wind swaying the beige curtains makes this class feel even more like a silent, colorless film shot in a faraway world.\
` Inside the classroom lighted by the western sun, the dead-eyed students write down rows upon rows of characters in their notebooks as they gulp in great lungfuls of chalk dust.\
` As weird as it may sound, these recent days I feel like time is advancing in a MUDDY way.@
` As if every day the same film is projected at exactly the same time...@ It's a strange feeling indeed.\
` A repetitive, invariable, futile routine.\
` At some point in time which I'm unable to specify, all the color and sound of this dull world vanished.\
` However, I'm not really affected by it.@ Instead, I embrace this indescribable heat inside me and, as usual, forget myself writing scribbles in my notebook.\
` I let my pencil run silently across the notebook, and draw a circle in a page of my brand-new college notebook, filled with blue ruled lines.@ It's the same circle I'm used to draw every day.@
((002:))
` This way, I immerse myself in my own wet, sticky dreamworld...\
` The circle represents the Earth.@
` Since I created it, it is only mine.\
` Unfortunately, this Earth of mine I drew will have to be destroyed.@ It's a 1:1 miniature of the Earth where we're all living now.@
` The polluted sky and oceans, the garbage dump-like cities, and the social structure designed for enslaved, lifeless people are exactly like our world.\
` The apocalypse always comes when you least expect it.@
` I draw small circles around the main circle.@ These are explosions from a new type of nuke that burn and destroy everything.@
` All of a sudden, an explosion occurs without warning.@
` The earth splits and cracks, the sky rampages, and flames erupt creating a burning hell.@
` Their fingers and earlobes blown away, people run from the flames aimlessly.@ They escape without knowing what the hell happened to Earth so out of the blue.\
` My apocalyptic fantasy doesn't stop there.\
` However, there's nowhere to escape.@ It's impossible, because the Earth itself is falling apart and is about to disappear.@
` Despite they run so desperately their legs are torn off, and so fast their lungs burn out, there's just no way they can escape from the end of the world.\
` In an automatic motion, I keep drawing more and more circles.@ The places where the nukes explode meet a gruesome, ultimate destruction.@
` As people gradually lose their own world, they kick each other to make way and crawl around the surface looking to shelter themselves.\
` I leave a single safe place on purpose while the rest of the world is being engulfed by flames.@
` After trampling down on others in order to survive, those ugly, pathetic creatures called humans group there to save their lives.@
` As they breathe out poisonous gas from their almost rotten mouths, every single one of them start pleading for mercy.@
` "Please save us!"
` "Why are we being punished?!"\
` I slowly lift my right arm as if teasing them, and as I hear their desperate appeals and screams, I mercilessly draw the last nuke.\
` At that very moment, I feel like I'm actually hearing the screams of millions of people at once.@
` I feel an intense rush of blood through my whole body.\
` This unspeakable excitement makes me feel agitated.@
` Once I wake up from my fantasy, I slowly let go of my pencil and I'm astonished to notice my palm is sweating A LOT.\
((003:))
` Every time I'm struck with these vivid delusions during the day, I feel shivers fierce enough to make my hair stand on end.@
` However, I can't deny I feel a bit of guilty pleasure when the blood pumps through my veins.\
` During class, there's a part of me that enjoys intoxicating itself with drug-like fantasies, and a part of me that fears the other one.@
` Those wild dreams become more lifelike and realistic every day, and at the same time, the real world becomes more dull and soundless.
` Blazing, blood-pounding insanity on one side, and dry, withered rationality on the other.\
` Perhaps I'm getting far away from this boring reality as I tread little by little into the world of madness...\
((004:))
` Thinking about that, I let my gaze wander through space, and then...\
` "Huhuhuhu..."@
` I hear a dry laugh echoing through the classroom.@
` Strangely, despite that laugh should be soundless to me, I can hear it loud and clear.@
` "Huhuhuhu..."@
` The students stop writing in their notebooks and turn their heads to that creepy laugh.\
` The student laughing is a girl that sits diagonally to me.@
` Obviously, I know her face.@ However, I can't recall her name.\
` She gazes absent-mindedly outside the window, and despite the teacher didn't even call out to her, she slowly stands up, all while chuckling.@
` As she's illuminated by the western sun, her silhouette is projected in the wall before her, just like a faint shadow picture.\
` "What's wrong, Ohta?"@
` The teacher that was writing rows of characters akin to worms crawling across the blackboard stops his hand holding the chalk.@
` Ohta...@ Yeah, she's Ohta.@ She's the student council president, and she's always surrounded by a group of girls.@
` "Huhu, huhuhu...@ Haha, hahahahahahaha..."@
` Her giggles turn into a loud laughter, and still facing to the window, she keeps laughing joyfully.\
` The class looks at her a bit spooked.@
` "Hey, what's wrong with Kanako?"@
` "She creeps me out..."@
` The students' whispers mix with Ohta's chuckles.\
` Then, Ohta strikes her desk full-force with both hands.@
` All of a sudden, the classroom becomes dead silent.@
` Before the perplexed stare of the students, she mutters a single word in a low voice:@
` "Sex."\
` After a brief moment, the entire classroom burst into laughter.@
` "Hahahahahahaha!@ That was nasty, Kanako, but really funny!"@
` "Huahahahaha!@ What the fuck, Ohta?!@ You horny or somethin'?!"@
` Without paying attention to the desperate efforts of the teacher to calm things down, the students' hysterical laughter pierces the air and resounds through the classroom.\
` "Huhu, huhuhu.@ Gimme some, c'mon.@ Gimme some dick.@ I can't take it anymore.@ C'mon, be cool.@ I want a dick.@ You hear me?@ A DICK!@ I wanna a dick!@ Put it inside me!@ Thrust it into my hot, wet, drenched pussy!@ I wanna have sex, right here, right now!@ I wanna do iiit...!@ I WANNA FUUUUUCK!!@ Sex, sex, sex, sex, sex SEX SEX SEX SEX SEX SEX SEX SEX SEX SEX SEX SEX...!!"\
` The students' laughs gradually fade out.@
` Just like a broken CD player, she repeats the word "Sex" endlessly.@
` Now, not a single student is laughing anymore.@
` It's clear to everyone that Ohta's not in her right mind.\
` "KYAAAAAAAAAAAH!!"@
` At that moment, a girl's scream breaks apart the desolate atmosphere of the classroom.@
` The students watch the scene with their breath taken away.@
` Ohta tears out her own face scratching it with her nails, and as a result, both of her hands become red with blood.\
` The teacher that was watching dumbfounded comes to his senses and rushes over to Ohta.@
` He holds down her hands, but it's too late.@ Both her face and her uniform are already dyed bright red with blood, a vivid hue that reminds me of tomato juice.@
` Amidst an eerie silence, an abnormal nervousness overwhelms the students.\
` Immediately, two boys along with the teacher holding her down take Ohta, who is competely covered by blood, to the infirmary.\
` After Ohta and the others leave the classroom, the noise resumes and the students begin to make a fuss again, as if they cut a tense thread hanging over them.@
` Every single of the students was creeped out by her sudden self-harming attack.@
` However, as for me...@ I know it's strange, but I felt an indescribable affinity towards her.@
` That's right...@ She entered the realm of madness a bit earlier than me.@ Perhaps that's the reason.@
` After seeing that puddle of bright red blood inside the classroom illuminated by the western sun, bit by bit, reality started to gain color again.\
` Before long, I hear the distant sound of an ambulance coming closer.\
((005:))
` It's been three days since Ohta's incident.@
` Out of the blue, she lost her mind and began to scratch her own face until turning it into a bloody pulp.\
` According to her family and friends' testimonies, she behaved completely normal before that day.@
` However, she went crazy specifically in the day of the accident.\
` "Y'know?@ The other day I tried to talk with her like usual, and Kanako turned her face slowly with a creeeeepy smile.@
` I kid you not, that was DISGUSTING!@ It was exactly like the face of a ghost I saw in a TV show the other day.@ Maybe by then she had already gone bonkers, who knows?"\
` Naturally, Ohta became the trending topic of every classroom for the next two days after the incident.@
` They say she was hospitalized in a general hospital in order to operate her, and that she'll be transferred to a psychiatric ward next week.@
` People's also spreading careless rumors about the source of her insanity.@
` That she was always neurotic, that she did drugs...@
` There's even a theory according to which her boyfriend cheated on her and she was left so traumatized that wanted someone to rape her.\
` However, as anybody would expect, three days later people got tired of that topic and established a sort of weird "pact of silence", so Ohta's incident became a taboo issue.\
` Until yesterday's afternoon everyone was talking excitedly about Ohta, but as soon as someone suggested making a pact of silence, they immediately turned tails.@
` I think every single of them are coward sheeps.@ They act according to other people's reactions, and instead of holding their own opinion, they follow blindly whatever trash the mass believes.@ They're really stupid.\
` That's why, despite she lost her mind, I can't help but relate to Ohta.\
((0128:))
` "Haa... Haa... Haa..."@
` With Saori on my shoulder, I manage to run up the hallway, but exhausted, I lay her on the floor.@
` She's still breathing hard.
` Her face is as red as if she just finished running a marathon, and a bit of sweat drops from her forehead.\
` What the hell was that?!
` What was that flood of electricity running through my head?
` Was that discharge that made Saori like this?
` Did that drive her crazy just like it made my head go numb?
` "Saori, Saori!"@
` I shake Saori by her shoulders.@
` ...... They're slim.@
` I never knew her shoulders were THIS slender.@
` Saori slowly opens her eyelids and answers feebly:@
` "Y-Yuusuke..."\
` I don't know if she recognized me, but she jumps right into my chest as if she were afraid of something.@
` "T-That current...@ That electric current...@ I don't want to go through it ever again!"@
` She shakes her head vigorously as her slender shoulders quiver.@
` "I'm scared, Mom..."
` "S-Saori..."\
` Her cheerfulness, talkativeness, friendiness, the passion she had for volleyball...@
` Everything about her made me think she was a formidable girl.@
` However, after seeing how afraid she is of ghosts and her current, pitiable state, I realize that was only my own preconception.\
` To be honest, back in the rooftop I thought it wasn't like her to be SO scared of ghosts.@
` That was because I believed mistakenly she was strong-willed.@
` I thought she wasn't acting like her usual self.@
` I was pretty sure she was just a little scared and that she'd come back to her usual playfulness in no time.\
` I convinced myself she was a strong, confident girl.@
` However, this girl crying and trembling in my chest now is the opposite of the image I had of her.@ She's like a fragile, spoiled little child.@
` Her shoulders are so thin they could easily be broken apart just by applying a little of force.@
` Her flimsy arms cling to me desperately.@
` Her hair smells slightly like shampoo.@
` I finally come to realize...@
` that THIS is Saori's true self.\
` "Saori..."@
` I try to call her name as gently as I can.@
` "Don't worry.@ There's no current anymore."@
` Languidly, Saori directs her tearful eyes towards me.@
` "Yuu... Suke..."@
` "I'm telling you, you won't receive another shock like that."@
` "...For real?"@
` Saori answers with a feeble question.\
` "What we should be doing now is moving on.@ Can you stand up?"@
` "...Yes."@
` She nods and gets away from my chest.@
` She draws her knees up, raises her hips and tries to stand up.@
` However, her knees give up and she falls on her rear.@
` "Yuu... suke..."@
` Still with her bum stuck to the floor and her knees up, she turns her sobbing gaze towards me and calls my name faintly.\
` This may sound inappropriate, but I think she's very cute in this state.@
` I crouch and turn my back to her.@
` "Alright, I'll carry you on my back.@ Hop on."@
` "Yuusuke..."@
` Saori whispers my name and braces my shoulders with both arms.@
` I muster strenght and stand up, but since it's too much momentum, Saori loses balance after two or three steps.@ That's because, contrary to what I expected, she was as light as a feather.\
` I start to walk with Saori on my back.@
` She clings firmly to my back as she shivers.@
` I don't know what effect the current had on her, but I can tell she's WAY too scared.@
` Perhaps Saori was always a scaredy-cat?\
` I'm doing all what I can to restrain my fear before Saori, but just like her, I could break out shivering any moment now.@
` If I became agitated now, that would only make Saori all the more anxious.@
` I advance slowly without hurry.\
` Anyway, we have to escape where no one sees us.@
` Someone might come for us from the student council room.@
` I don't think those girls and Tsukishima would pose much of a threat, but I can't help but have a bad feeling about them.@
` That electric current, Ohta coming out of the hospital...@ It's all so weird.@
` I know I'm exaggerating, but perhaps my animal instinct warned me about a potential danger from them.\
` For now, I'll head to the second gym where Saori left her lugagge.@
` We'll hide there and rest for a while, and once Saori recovers, we'll get out from school.@
` After that, I'll call my uncle, report him everything I saw here, and forget everything about this incident.@
` I don't care what happens after.@
` Once I report the events, my work ends there.\
` Anyway, it's time to run away.@
` I'm gonna head to the second gym.\
` The empty gym at night is always deserted and flooded with yellow moonlight.@
` Carrying Saori on my back, I cross the entrance door made of hard glass and enter the building.@
` I open wide the door and set foot on the arena.@
` Golden moonlight sheds light inside the gym.@
` Only my wild breath echoes through the slightly dusty, chilly air.\
` We're pretty far from the student council.@
` It seems Saori's shivering has calmed down almost completely.@
` However, in exchange for that, the force she's clinging to me with has increased.@
` It's like she's pushing her whole self onto me.\
` Both of her soft breasts are pressing against my back.@
` Her warm breath blows upon my nape.@
` "S-Saori...@ I can't breathe."@
` "Ah!@ S-Sorry..."@
` With her face dyed red, she loosens her entire body.@
` "I-I'm just..."@
` "It's fine, don't sweat it.\
` However, after I give three steps forward, she presses herself against me again.@
` Her plump breasts, her warm breath, her silky thighs, her soft buttocks...@
` It has been only a while since I saw her in all her glory.@
` That's why that lower part of myself is reacting inevitably.@
` "......"@
` I lean forward so that she doesn't notice my red face and my lower half.\
` Is she so scared that she NEEDS to cling to me so badly?@
` No, this actually looks more like...@
` "Yuu... suke..."@
` Saori embraces me stronger than ever before.@
` I feel her arousing, sweet breath in my nape.@
` She looks exactly like those girls of the student council we met before.\
` "What's wrong, Saori?!"@
` "Ah, sorry!@ Umm, I..."@
` At that instant, she draws back immediately.@
` However, after a while, she starts clinging to me again, little by little.@
` She's just repeating the same actions from before.\
` "!"@
` Saori presses her pelvis against my hips.@
` I feel her soft and warm abdomen thoroughly.@
` "Nh...@ Fuh...@ Haa..."@
` Saori lets out a painful gasp.@
` "Saori!"@
` When I shout her name in a slightly loud voice, she suddenly realizes what she's doing and awkwardly recedes.@
` "I-It's not what you think!@ I.... I just...!"\
` As we talk, we reach the volleyball club's gym.@
` I open the door, enter, and close it again with the key so that nobody comes in.@
` The scent of wooden flooring drifts faintly in the air.@
` Only the moonlight illuminates the gym from the window.\
` Saori's school and sports bag remain alone on the floor, refreshingly tidied up.@
` "Let's rest here."@
` I sit Saori on a chair without backrest.@
` When she slides down from my back, our bodies touch each other.@
` "Haa!@ Nh!"@
` Saori lets out an erotic moan and shrinks her body.\
` "A-AHEM!"@
` I cough.@
` "......"@
` Saori looks at me with dampened eyes and cheeks flushed bright red.@
` She looks embarrassed, demanding, and anxious all at the same time.@ Her expression is as complex as it can get.@
` What in the world is wrong with her?\
` "Saori...@ How do you feel?"@
` I crouch in order to meet her gaze directly.@
` "Huh?!"@
` Saori exclaims in a hoarse, loud voice.@
` "Does your head hurt?"@
` "N-No...@ I think I'm fine already..."@
` "I see.@ That's good to hear."@
` "......"@
` Immediately after, she falls silent again and keeps staring at me.\
` "You can walk on your own now, right?@ Let's go home before they find us.@ I'll carry your bags."@
` I take both her school bag and her sport bag.@
` "We'd better get out of here as soon as possible.@ C'mon, let's go."@
` I stand before the entrance and open it with the key.@ However...@
` "Saori?"@
` For some reason, Saori doesn't show any will to get up.\
` She just keeps gazing at me from the chair as she braces herself weakly.@
` I notice she's quivering.@
` "What is it?@ Are you still afraid?"@
` Still standing in front of the door, I leave the bags on the floor at my feet and approach Saori.\
` "N-No!"@
` Saori's body stiffens up all of a sudden.@
` I stop on my tracks.@
` "W-What's wrong?"@
` "No!@ Don't come!"@
` Her cheeks furious red, Saori screams on the verge of tears.\
` I hesitate for a bit, but finally decide to approach Saori anyway.@
` We'll get nowhere like this.@
` She looks a lot better than before, so we should focus on leaving the school urgently.@
` "D-Don't come near me, please!"@
` "What's the problem?@ I don't get it."@
` Turning a deaf ear to her pleads, I keep getting closer to her.\
` Saori's gazing at me like she's looking at something scary.@
` "C'mon, let's go home."@
` I try to grab her arm, but then...\
` "No!@ Get away!"@
` *THUD!*@
` Saori pushes me away with both palms.@
` Her thrust was forceful, but not very powerful.@ She only pushed me half a step away.@
` "Saori?!"@
` She looks like she's about to cry.@
` "Why...?"\
` Just then, I notice a shining liquid dripping from the zone of her butt.@
` "Saori...?"@
` "Ah!"@
` Presuming right away that I noticed it, Saori covers her face in embarrassment and hides her crotch awkwardly pushing down her skirt.@
` Instead of hiding it, that only makes it all the more evident.\
` *Psssh*@
` Doing wet sounds, several lewd, bright drops flow through her thighs.@
` "Ah!@ Aaah..."@
` At first I thought she peed herself.@
` However, that doesn't seem to be the case.@
` That sticky, overflowing fluid is clearly not urine.\
` It's love juice.@
` The liquid that girls secrete when they're sexually aroused.@
` That fluid is gleaming under the moonlight.@
` As viscous love juice leaks across her thighs, Saori trembles while she looks at me fixedly and braces herself.\
` "S-Saori..."@
` In an attempt to break this awkward silence, I call her name.@
` *Twitch!*@
