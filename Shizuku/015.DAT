"The fact that it could escalate into a criminal case is all the more reason for not involving myself in it."@>
"Well, if you put it like that, I can't quite reply anything, but if possible, I'd like you to cooperate with me."#

{BLOCK:1}
"Don't even joke about it, please.@ What are you going to do if I fall into danger?"@>
"You're completely right.@ That's why I'm asking you, to respect your opinion."@>
"In that case, my answer is NO.@ First off, how can you involve a student in such a risky case?"@>
"Ugh..."@>
Struck in a weak point, my uncle overreacts.#

{BLOCK:2}
"I-I plan to compensate you with a part-time job pay..."@>
"Working part-time is against the school rules."@>
"Uuh..."@>
After taking yet another blow, my uncle overreacts even more.#

{BLOCK:3}
"I'm sorry, but please look for someone else.@ Also, I think it'd be better for the school to stop obsessing so much with protecting its reputation and start a real police investigation at once."@>
As he hears what I have to say, he makes a sour face.@>
"That inflexible side of yours is exactly like your father's.@ Both of you are upright and experts at hitting people where it hurts..."@>
"I think YOU are too easygoing."@>
"Yeah, like I said, two birds of a feather."#

{BLOCK:4}
After talking for a while more, I decline formally his proposal.@>
He kept a disappointed look on his face, but I don't have anything to do with this.\c

{BLOCK:5}
I didn't tell anything to my uncle, but just like Ohta, I'm about to open the door to insanity.@>
If I tread further into that realm, I know I won't be able to return to this world ever again.#

{BLOCK:6}
I plan to go there someday.@>
I want to open that door towards madness and head to the world beyond this one...@>
However, it's still too early for that.@>
The door slips in and out of my view, just like a mirage.@>
At this stage, I'm slowly tumbling down my way towards it.#

{BLOCK:7}
It's no use to try and reach the door myself.@>
Someday it will come naturally to me.@>
So, for now,@>
I'll keep waiting...#
