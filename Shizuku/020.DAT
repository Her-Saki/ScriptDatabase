"I don't know anything about these antennas and denpa waves you're talking about."@>
I feel like Tsukishima is telling me nonsense on purpose to confuse me.@>
I wonder if she's making fun of me.@>
Yeah, that must be it.@>
If not for that, there'd be no reason for Tsukishima to be talking with me.#

{BLOCK:1}
"Are you poking fun at me?"@>
{CHARA:r03}
"No.@ I'm telling you about the denpa waves."@>
"Do you seriously think you can transform into a antenna that receives denpa waves?"@>
"Yes."#

{BLOCK:2}
"No human can do that."@>
"Yes, I can.@ For starters, human thoughts are..."@>
"Stop messing with me!"@>
"!"@>
{CHARA:r01}
I yell unintentionally.@>
Tsukishima retracts her head in surprise and points her clear eyes towards me.#

{BLOCK:3}
"S-Sorry, I'm racking my brains over mental illnesses right now.@ I'd rather not listen anything about denpa waves or stuff like that."@>
Tsukishima shows a sad expression.@>
Perhaps she got fed up of my party pooper attitude.#

{BLOCK:4}
"You're just like everyone else, huh?"@>
Tsukishima says.#

{BLOCK:5}
"Yeah, maybe you're right.@ I'm just like everybody else.@ I'd hate to be above them or below them."@>
That's also what I hate the most about myself, so choose to I open up my heart with her.\c

{BLOCK:6}
Tsukishima closes her eyes, turns on her heels, crosses the door and climbs down the stairs sluggishly.#

{BLOCK:7}
She has become a mysterious girl.@>
She's now a different person from the girl I used to know.@>
I wonder what happened to her...#
