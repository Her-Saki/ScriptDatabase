"By the way, you're Mr. Nagase's relative, aren't you?@ I didn't know that."@>
Unexpectedly, Tsukishima brings up that topic.@>
"So you overheard us, huh?"@>
"No, I didn't hear you.@ I received your denpa waves."#

{BLOCK:1}
It looks like Tsukishima overheard our conversation from beginning to end.@>
What do I do?@>
It was supposed to be classified information...#

{BLOCK:2}
"Um, Tsukishima..."@>
"You can call me Ruriko, Naga."@>
She changed "Nagase" to "Naga".@ However, I think it's more natural of her new self to call me like that.#

{BLOCK:3}
"Ruriko, please don't tell anybody about what you just heard... I mean, received."@>
"Do you mean your conversation with Mr. Nagase?"@>
"Yes."@>
"Huhuhu", Ruriko laughs.#

{BLOCK:4}
"That's right, it's supposed to be a top-secret investigation."@>
As I feared, Ruriko hea--... received the whole conversation.@>
"Y-Yeah, so, please..."@>
"I know how to keep secrets, you know?"@>
"Okay.@ It's a promise, then."@>
"Yes, of course."\c

Then, the afternoon bell to return to classes rings.@>
It's 13:00 P.M.@>

"It's time to go back.@ Anyway, remember you promised."@>
"Yes."@>
Ruriko holds out her pinky finger.@>
"?"@>
"Won't you do a pinky promise?"@>
"O-Oh, sure."#

{BLOCK:7}
She looks like a child unmindful of the filth of the world.@>
I wonder what happened to her in the year we stayed apart...@>
I'm sorry for my uncle, but more than Ohta, I feel like I want to know this girl better.#

{BLOCK:8}
I tangle my finger with Ruriko's slender pinky.@>
We exchange promises, and then I leave that place.#
