The bell rings marking the beginning of the final class of the day.@>

{BG:019912}
Amidst the eerie silence of the classroom, an emotionless teacher reads a text in a language I don't comprehend.@>
The sound of the students running their pens across their notebooks mixes with the sound of the teacher hitting the blackboard with the chalk.#

{BLOCK:2}
This looks exactly like a funeral.@>
What I'm hearing is the national language of the country that beat Japan in the war.@>
The native tongue of the nation that crushed ours incinerating tens of thousands of its people with nukes.@>
If we're forced to learn their language now is because countless persons were nuked to death in the war; because their demises led to Japan's defeat.@>
It's a funeral.@>
A funeral for the tens of thousands of people who were burned to extinction by the nukes.#

{BLOCK:3}
I hear a sutra.@>
A long...@ long...@ s@u@t@r@a...#

Mizuho's standing before me.@>
She's staring at me with an anxious look.@>
"Why did Kanako lose her mind?",@>
she asks feebly.#

{BLOCK:6}
"She was driven mad",@>
I answer.@>
"By who?@ Who drove Kanako mad?@ Who drove my dear Kanako mad?!@>
"Who, you ask?"@>
I laugh.#

{BLOCK:7}
"Everyone.@>

See all those people around us?@>
It was that guy, and that other guy, and that guy too, and he, she, you, I..."\c

"No, I didn't!"@>
"Everybody is to blame, no exceptions.@>
All of them, nemine contradicente, told her:"#

That guy, and that guy, and that guy there, and that other guy too...@>
You, I, the dogs, the cats, the cars, the planes, the air, the sun...#

{BLOCK:11}
Everyone and everything kept repeating her to death:#

{BLOCK:12}
GET CRAZY, GET CRAZY, GET CRAZY, GET CRAZY, GET CRAZY, GET CRAZY, GET CRAZY, GET CRAZY, GET CRAZY, GET CRAZY, GET CRAZY, GET CRAZY...\c

{BLOCK:13}
"So that's why Kanako lost herself?"@>
Mizuho says as her eyes become cloudy.@>
Just like a little child spooked by a jumpscare video, Mizuho cowers covering her ears with both hands.\c

The sound of the students running their pens across their notebooks mixes with the sound of the teacher hitting the blackboard with the chalk.#

{BLOCK:17}
My shirt glues to my sweaty skin,@>
and my heart is beating so fast my chest hurts.#

{BLOCK:18}
That pitch-black shadow inside me draws away very, very slowly.#

{BLOCK:19}
The door to the world of insanity is right before me.@>
I can't wait to open it wide and jump into it at once.#
