The last bell rings bringing today's classes to an end.@>
Since students from different classrooms visit each other, the mood becomes rowdier than usual.@>
Some of them remain in school in order to engage in club activities and others stay for supplementary lessons, while others go straight home.@>
After I'm done preparing myself to return home, I leave my bag on the desk and stand up.#

{BLOCK:2}
Alright, this is where the investigation begins.@>
That said, I have no clue where to start.@>
Geez, my uncle gave me a pretty annoying task...\c

{BLOCK:3}
Out of the blue, my classmate Kanako Ohta suffered a mental breakdown.@ However, she left a meaningful diary behind.@>
In that diary, whose intention seems to be communicating something to someone else, is written the possible cause of her madness, just like a riddle waiting to be solved.@>
And those contents can potientially turn this incident into a full-blown criminal case.#

{BLOCK:4}
Following unknown purposes, Ohta came to school every night since two or three weeks prior to her breakdown.@>
What exactly she did there is a mystery, but a medical check-up performed on her in a hospital revealed she had sexual intercourse with a boy.@>
This brings up the question of whether she performed said acts in school or not.#

{BLOCK:5}
Students using their sacred academy as a hot-pillow joint is a hard blow to the school's reputation.@>
Also, Ohta mentioned in her diary that many people participate in these clandestine meetings.@>
And if this incident happens to include aggravations such as drugs, alcohol and rape, the problem escalates to a whole new level of danger.@>
That's why the school wants to deal with it personally before the police chimes in.\c

{BLOCK:6}
By coincidence, the teacher assigned to solve this issue was my uncle.@>
Given how lazy he is, I bet he accepted the orders from the upper echelon reluctantly, but regardless, he must present a satisfactory report to the big shots of the school under the principal.#

{BLOCK:7}
My uncle and other teachers came to patrol the school at night just as the diary suggested.@>
However, they closed up that investigation because they didn't find anything.@>
My uncle could have just reported "there was nothing abnormal" and call it a day...#

{BLOCK:8}
But, pretty unlike him, he didn't.@>
After all, a passage in Ohta's diary indicates that the participants of the orgy are keeping an eye on the teachers.#

{BLOCK:9}
If the teachers are surveilled by the culprits, it's possible that they were wary of the investigation of last night.@>
How did they catch wind of the teachers spying on them?@ Were they monitoring every teacher minutely?@ That's unknown, but the fact remains that those guys (girls?) never appeared.@>
No, perhaps they never existed in the first place.@>
Yeah.@ Maybe it was all Ohta's delusion...#

{BLOCK:10}
Nevertheless, their disappearance wasn't enough to clear my uncle's suspicions.@>
That's why he decided to approach this case from a different perspective.@>
If the teachers are monitored, anyone else other than them should investigate.@>
Someone aside from them that doesn't arise suspicion by staying in the school.@>
Yeah, a student.@>
It's completely natural that my uncle nominated me, his nephew, for this task.#

{BLOCK:11}
I accepted my uncle's request, so I must investigate if what Ohta wrote in her diary is true by collecting evidence tonight at school.@>
I'm positive...@>
that no matter how alert the culprits are, they will have another clandestine meeting as soon at the school loosens its grip.#

{BLOCK:12}
The motive is stated in Ohta's diary.@>
For some reason, they can't stand a single day without having intercourse.@>
Judging by her writing, she was like a drug addict starving to consume substances, so perhaps (and I'm aware this may sound too simplistic) the other members suffer from the same withdrawal symptoms.@>
That's merely what I imagine, though.#
{CHARA:r99}
\e

{BLOCK:13}
Anyway, the survey will take place tonight.@>
I'm in possession of the master key required to enter the school and the access code, 0824.@>
Now, all that is left is to wait for the night to fall.@>
However, there's some prep work I'd like to do before.@>
That is, collecting information.@>
In the meantime, there's two students that I can consult as information sources.\c
{CHARA:c20}
\e

{BLOCK:14}
The first one is Mizuho Aihara, from 2-A class.@>
She's the student's council secretary and Ohta's longtime friend, who was also part of the S.C. as vice president.@>
Since she belongs to the student council, she's very knowledgeable about the school in general, and she's also eager to engage in the survey.@>
She might know about how Ohta behaved with her friends before the incident or if there was something strange with her lately.\c
{CHARA:c09}
\e

{BLOCK:15}
The second one is Saori Shinjo from 2-D class.@>
I haven't met her yet, but according to my uncle, she belongs to the female volleyball club.@>
Last night she stayed up late and spotted some suspicious shadows near the school buildings.@>
That could be a great hint to solve the case.#

{BLOCK:16}
I'm going to meet both of them and listen to their stories.#
