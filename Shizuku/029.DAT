Who should I visit first?@>
I believe Mizuho is the one who can provide with me the most useful information.@>
On the other hand, I should meet Shinjou because she's the only witness.@>
Anyway...\c

{BLOCK:1}
Unable to collect my thoughts, I leave the classroom and step in the hallway, but then...@>
{CHARA:r10}
"Umm..."@>
A girl I don't know talks to me.\c
{BGMPLAY:07}
\e

{BLOCK:2}
"What is it?"@>
"Are you from B class?"@>
Her eyes are clear and straight.@>
"Yeah, why?"@>
"Oh...@ Then, is Nagase still in your classroom?"@>
"Huh?@ Yeah..."@>
{CHARA:r11}
"Sorry, but could you please bring him here?"@>
She joins her hands in a pleading pose.#

{BLOCK:3}
Who is she?@ I don't recall seeing her before.@>
"I'm Nagase..."@>
{CHARA:r12}
"Huh?!@ Oh, I see..."@>
Her expressions change drastically from one moment to another.@>
{CHARA:r13}
She points to her chest and names herself.@>
"I'm Saori.@ Saori Shinjo."@>
"Shinjo from the volleyball club?"@>
Hey, she's the witness I was about to meet!\c
{CHARA:r12}
\e

{BLOCK:4}
"Do you know me?@ Wait, don't tell me I've become a celebrity!"@>
She claps her hands as her face turns bright with joy.@>
"No, it's just I had some business with you.@ I was about to go meet you."@>
{CHARA:r10}
"Oh..."@>
This time she drops her shoulders in disappointment.@ I can never get enough of her reactions.@>
"You mean what happened last night, right?@ You wanna hear about what I saw?"@>
"Yeah..."@>
"Okay, I'll tell you.@ That's what Mr. Nagase sent me here for, after all."#

{BLOCK:5}
She says, dropping her shoulders to imitate a hunchback.@>
""Uh, sorry, Shinjo, but could you tell my nephew what you just told me now about those fishy shadows?@ He's going to patrol the school tonight...""@>
It looks like she's mimicking my uncle.@ Not a perfect imitation, but the key mood is there.@>
{CHARA:r13}
"That's what he said."@>
Shinjo giggles and winks.#

{BLOCK:6}
At first sight I thought she'd be more serious, but the more I talk with her, the more I realize how friendly she is.@>
"You're a very funny girl, Shinjo."@>
{CHARA:r16}
"I get that a lot."@>
She says with a bashful smile.@>
"By the way, what are you investigating, Nagase?@ Did an incident occur yesterday?"@>
"Oh, it's nothing too important..."#

{BLOCK:7}
My uncle really got me into trouble...@>
I thought it'd only be Mizuho, but now Shinjo is involved in this matter...@>
Now Mizuho, Ruriko and Shinjo know that I'll be surveying the school tonight.@>
These three have some kind of link to the case, so I must be careful not to tell them anything important.@ VERY careful.#

{BLOCK:8}
It seems Shinjo wasn't well informed about this by my uncle.@>
That's fine for me.@ I'll try not to touch the heart of the matter.@>
{CHARA:r14}
"First Mr. Nagase doesn't tell me anything, and now you...@ *Sob!*"@>
Shinjo covers her eyes and pretends to cry.@>
{CHARA:r13}
"But don't worry!@ Whatever you know, I won't tell anybody."@>
And then she winks.@ She really jumps between expressions quickly.#

{BLOCK:9}
"Yeah, I'd appreciate that."@>
"But I actually know, y'know?"@>
"Huh?"@>
I gulp a bit.@>
Out of the blue, Shinjo mutters:@>
{CHARA:r16}
"This is actually BIG trouble, isn't it?"@>
She says narrowing her eyes.#

{BLOCK:10}
"Uh, yeah..."@>
Seeing my awkward reaction, Shinjo laughs.@>
"You've just gotten yourself involved in a terrible calamity, aren't you?"@>
She says in a creepy tone.@>
Is she acting to liven things up or something?\c
{CHARA:r10}
\e

{BLOCK:11}
"More importantly, what I want to ask you is..."@>
I cut her short to change topic, but Shinjo places her index finger before her lips and says "shhh".@>
"They say walls have ears.@ We gotta be careful with our surroundings, or someone might hear us!"@>
"Huh?"@>
"It seems no one is overhearing us now, though."@>
It looks like she's getting the wrong idea about this.@ She's acting like this is a detective show.#

{BLOCK:12}
"Well, anyway, what did you want to ask me?"@>
Shinjo looks at me with upturned eyes.@>
"Well, first of all..."@>
{CHARA:r13}
"C'mon, I'm ready for any question!"@>
She says beating her chest.#

{BLOCK:13}
Well, what will I ask?\n\e

{BLOCK:14}
{XPOS:6}
{SPEED:0}
1. "Tell me about those suspicious shadows."\n\e

{BLOCK:15}

2. "Did you notice anything weird in the club recently?"\n\e
