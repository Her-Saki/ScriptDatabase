"Please tell me about those suspicious human-like shadows you saw last night."@>
{CHARA:r10}
"Okay..."@>
She lifts her gaze slowly towards the ceiling and starts recounting what happened.#

{BLOCK:1}
"Our volleyball club is one of the strongest teams of the whole prefecture, and we're usually either runner-ups or champions, so naturally we have to practice extra hard.@ We're gonna become seniors next year, y'know, so we're running tight on time and everybody's training like there's no tomorrow."@>
Her intonation is wide-ranging, and her voice clear.@ She skillfully controls her tempo like an actress delivering her lines; in short, Shinjo is an excellent orator.#

{BLOCK:2}
"That's why recently we stay up quite late to practice.@ Yesterday's training was particularly long, and after we finished we began chatting.@ I'm quite the chatterbox, so I kept prattling without even changing clothes.@ I was left behind and had to close the gym door before going home."@>
She makes a little gesture with her hands as if closing an invisible door.@ Any onlooker would say she looks oddly excited.#

{BLOCK:3}
"I think that was around 10 P.M. last night.@ Or was it 9:30?@ Or 10:30?@ Well, it doesn't matter, doesn't it?"@>
Of course it matters!@ That said, I don't want to spoil her fluent speech, so instead I say "wait".@>
"It IS important.@ Please make an effort to remember what time it was."#

{BLOCK:4}
"Hmm...@ Oh, yeah, it was 10 P.M.@ At the club we have to fill a "leaving report", y'know?@ It's just a cheap notebook placed where we usually return the gym key.@ The person who last returns it must write down their name and leaving time.@ The last time I used the notebook was at 10 P.M...@ Yeah, that was it."@>
"Yep, no doubt", she nods.#

{BLOCK:5}
"So I locked the door, returned the key, jotted down my name and left the gym, then...@ Have you seen those cherry trees planted right in front of the gym?@ Well, there..."@>
She moves her face close to mine, and suddenly, she opens wide her eyes.@>
"I saw those mysterious silhouettes!"@>
She looks just like a grandma telling spooky stories to a child.@ Her acting includes a full repertory of gestures.#

{BLOCK:6}
"You're a grandma's girl, aren't you?"@>
{CHARA:r12}
"Eh?@ Y-Yeah, but...@ How could you tell?!@ Tell me, tell me!"@>
She flaps both of her arms and gazes at me delighted.@>
"It was only a guess.@ You're as eloquent as any granpa or grandma.\

{BLOCK:7}
"Wow, that was amazing!@ You deduced it just like a detective!@ I'm sure you'll become one in the future!"@>
That's an awfully simplistic prediction...@ Also, what does she find so great about that supposition?@>
"Forget about me.@ Keep going with the story."@>
{CHARA:r10}
"Oh, yeah, sorry."@>
She sticks out her tongue and hits her forehead.@>
"And then..."@>
She changes her expression abruptly and goes back to her previous horror taleteller tone.#

{BLOCK:8}
"......"@>
"So?"@>
"Umm...@ Where was I at again?"
"The shadows near the cherry tree!"@>
{CHARA:r11}
"Oh, that's right!@ Sorry!@ Being a scatterbrain is my only flaw."@>
Her ONLY flaw?@ I wouldn't be so sure about that...\c

{BLOCK:9}
"Okay, so, in short, various silhouettes were standing before the cherry trees."@>
""In short"?@ Well, whatever...@ Anyway, were there several of them?@ How many?"@>
"Hmm, yeah, I'm positive they were many.@ Three, perhaps?"@>
"Are you sure they were three?"@>
"Yeah, more or less."@>
So we're dealing with a trio, huh?@ If the persons Shinjo witnessed are involved in the incident, that means there's three more aside from Ohta.#

{BLOCK:10}
"I could have sworn they were my friends from the club trying to play a prank on me, so I approached them and yelled "Boo!"."@>
Shinjo laughs pulling her tongue and scratches her head.@>
"So you SAW them up close!"@>
"Yeah, but in the darkness...@ Well, obviously those girls turned out to be different people.@ I felt awkward, so I apologized and dashed the hell outta there."\c

{BLOCK:11}
"Those "girls"?"@>
"Yeah, they were girls.@ I knew from their uniform."@>
"All three of them?"@>
"Yes.@ All of them were wearing the uniform for girls."@>
"What about their faces or physique?@ Are they students from our school?@ Did you recognize someone among them?"@>
I bury Shinjo under a pile of questions.#

{BLOCK:12}
"Ugh, don't ask me everything at once, please!@ I told you, it was dark and I could barely see my own nose!@ I couldn't make out their faces well.@ I felt so embarrassed I couldn't possibly meet them face to face."@>
"Do you remember anything else?@ Any small detail can help."@>
"Hmm, I recall one of them had long hair."@>
"Long hair, huh?@ About as long as yours?"@>
"Yeah, I think so.@ Tied hair, I believe."@>
"You're unsure about that too?"@>
"Sorry."@>
Shinjo peeks at my face from below and smiles awkwardly.#

{BLOCK:13}
"I was worried because I felt bad about scaring them, but now that I think about it, it was really weird.@ Why would those girls in uniform be at school so late?@ There was something strange about them."@>
"What do you mean exactly by "weird"?@>
"Well, by "trying to scare them" I mean I shouted to the top of my lungs."@>
It's Shinjo we're talking about, so I figure she splitted their ears.#

{BLOCK:14}
"However, they didn't startle.@ In fact, they didn't react AT ALL.@ If I had to describe them, I'd say they were like zombies."@>
"No reactions...?"#

{BLOCK:15}
After hearing Shinjo's story, I remember Ohta's state of that day.@>
If someone screamed to scare her back then, I bet she wouldn't have batted an eyelash.@>
Yeah, exactly like a zombie.#

{BLOCK:16}
"Bizarre, isn't it?@ That's why I informed Mr. Nagase about it today.@ Oh, by the way, he's your uncle, isn't he?@ How do you feel about having a relative in the school?"@>
She can't keep focused on the topic for a single minute straight.@>
"Nothing in particular."@>
"Nothing in particular?@ What do you mean by "nothing in particular"?"@>
"Sorry, but let's talk about that later."@>
I curl my lips and cut short the conversation.#
