"Did you notice anything weird in the club recently?"@>
{CHARA:r12}
"Yep!"@>
Shinjo says firmly.#

{BLOCK:1}
"It indeed happened something strange."@>
"What?"@>
"Ghosts."@>
"Ghosts?"@>
{CHARA:r10}
"Yup.@ I'm only talking about those mysterious shadows I saw, though.@ Thing is, the girls of my club have observed odd human-like silhouettes late at night, too..."#

{BLOCK:2}
"Do you mean there are more witnesses aside from you?!"@>
"No, I wouldn't call them "witnesses", really.@ They only affirm they spotted some shadows, but nothing else.@ They kid with the rumor that those are ghosts.@ Have you heard that rumor?@ That supposedly ghosts wander in the gym?"#

{BLOCK:3}
"No, never."@>
"Well, my friends are pretty concerned about it, but it's only a silly story, isn't it?@ It's too simplistic of an explanation!"@>
"Don't you believe in ghosts, Shinjo?"@>
"You mean like spirits and aliens?@ I believe, of course, but only as fairy tales.@ Like, it never hurts to enjoy a bit of fantasy in one's life, doesn't it?"@>
Shinjo narrows her eyes and smiles ironically.#

{BLOCK:4}
"So you're a realistic person."@>
"I guess, but actually, I believe quite a lot in supernatural stuff.@ Thing is, it kinda pisses me off when people starts arguing about if the supposed "ghost" they saw was real or not.@ Do you know about those self-called "mediums"?"@>
"Yeah."@>
"Well, I'm not exactly a fan of them.@ There was this kid in middle school that used to bully people telling them they were possessed by evil spirits."#

{BLOCK:5}
"Hmm..."@>
"He used to gather people and play Kokkuri-san.@ Do you know what that is?@ Have you ever played it?"@>
"Yeah, but alone."@>
{CHARA:r16}
"Huh?@ Hold up...@ ALONE?@ Man, that's gloomy..."@>
"Mind your own business."@>
Shinjo chuckles.\c
{CHARA:r10}
\e

{BLOCK:6}
"It's weird, but at some point in our life we all believed in ghosts, guardian spirits and whatnot, right?@ Well, this guy assembled those believers to play Kokkuri-san and "somehow" attached evil spirits to them."@>
{CHARA:r15}
Her expression, as bright as a midsummer sunflower just a moment ago, becomes gradually darker.@ She keeps talking now with her head hanging low.@>
"A certain day I saw a girl being bullied like that.@ I lost my temper and yelled at the guy "Stop!" to defend her."#

{BLOCK:7}
Yeah, I can picture Shinjo doing that.@>
"And what do you think he said then?"@>
"Huh?@ What?"@>
""You're possessed by an evil spirit too".@ I know it was only a stupid kid's game, but I lost myself and...@ Well, he was a boy, but I punched him with all my might.@ And then it became a big fight with both of us wrestling on the floor..."\c
{CHARA:r1B}
\e

{BLOCK:8}
Shinjo looks at me upwards.@>
"I was an idiot, wasn't I?@ Ain't no way I could beat a boy in a fist fight..."@>
The mood became awkward for some reason.@>
{CHARA:r10}
"Sorry for telling you such a ridiculous story.@ Since that day I find it unpleasant when people make a big fuss about ghosts and stuff."@>
Shinjo shows me a bitter, apologetic smile.#

{BLOCK:9}
"Since when did your teammates saw those ghosts...@ I mean, those suspicious shadows?"@>
"Since two or three weeks ago."#

{BLOCK:10}
"Is there a place in particular they appear frequently?"@>
"Hmm, we don't usually get far from the gym, so I think they always come out near it."@>
So the shadows lurk near the gym, huh?@ It might be worth a shot to investigate there.#

{BLOCK:11}
"And which time do they usually show themselves?"@>
"I heard a lot that they appear late at night.@ Like, when we're leaving for home, so I think around 9 or 10 P.M."#

{BLOCK:12}
"Which days?"@>
"I don't think they come at specific days."@>
"Hmm..."#
