"Do you wanna ask me something else?"@>
Shinjo asks tilting her head.@>
"Hmm, I think this is enough for now..."@>
"Well?@ Was I helpful?"@>
"Yeah, you helped me quite a lot."@>
"I see.@ Good to hear."@>
She places her hand in her hip and nods cheerfully.#

{BLOCK:1}
"By the way, Nagase, I have a little proposal..."@>
Shinjo stares fixedly at me as she draws close.@>
I feel a little nervous.@>
"W-What proposal?"@>
Shinjo chuckles, lifts her index finger,@>
{CHARA:r13}
"Mind if I join the survey?"@>
and suggests that flashing a wink.#

{BLOCK:2}
"No, that's a no-go.@ This is not a game."@>
Yeah.@ This is a dangerous case that could escalate into a police investigation.@ It'd be unbeareable if she tagged along thinking we're playing detective.@>
{CHARA:r1D}
"So rude!"@>
She pouts and puts a hand against her hip.@>
"I'm not taking this as a game, y'know?!"@>
"Then why do you want to join?"#

{BLOCK:3}
"I told you before that I hate people that make a ruckus around ghosts and supernatural stuff, but if there's something I'll never tolerate is people CAUSING a ruckus!"@>
She clenches her fist in front of her chest.@>
{CHARA:r10}
"I'm positive these people are having fun spooking everyone with ghosts stories."#

{BLOCK:4}
I think that's pretty far from reality.@ They don't want to cause a fuss about ghosts.@>
After all, that might backfire and draw attention from people around the school.@>
Their actual goal lies somewhere else: having wild sexual parties without being noticed.\c
{CHARA:r12}

{BLOCK:5}
"That's why I wanna yell at 'em in their face: "STOP RIGHT NOW!""@>
Then, Shinjo peeks at my face.@>
{CHARA:r11}
"Well?@ Can I join?"@>
"But still..."\c
{CHARA:r10}
\e

{BLOCK:6}
However, I feel somewhat grateful that Shinjo wants to join the survey.@>
I'd feel reassured with her by my side.@>
After all, I'll be alone in this creepy school late at night.@ Creepier even if some weird incident were to happen.@>
With someone as light-hearted as a midsummer sun like her next to me, the mood will naturally brighten too.@>
That in itself would be a great advantage, without mentioning I'll able to rely more on her information.@>
Perhaps it'd be a good idea to consider herself seriously for this.\c
{CHARA:r11}
\e

{BLOCK:7}
"C'mon, pretty please!@ I'll do my very best.@ I swear I'll be helpful to you!"@>
She begs to join with an awkward smile.@>
Hmm, it's hard to turn her down when she asks me like that...#

{BLOCK:8}
Anyway, what will I do?\n\e

{BLOCK:9}
{XPOS:6}
{SPEED:0}
1. Let her join the investigation.\n\e

{BLOCK:10}
{XPOS:6}
{SPEED:0}
2. Reject her firmly.\n\e
