After pondering for a while, I state resolutely:@>
"I'm sorry, but I can't take you with me.@ It'll be late at night and dangerous."@>
{CHARA:r10}
Shinjo puffs out her cheeks a bit and is about to reply something, but instead she cuts herself short and gives a small sigh.@>
"Phew...@ Alright, you got it.@ You have a point."#

{BLOCK:1}
"Sorry."@>
"Oh, please don't worry!@ I know I was asking for something ridiculous."@>
Shinjo says with a sweet smile.@>
"If you wanna ask me something else, come to the second gym.@ I'll be there training in the club."@>
"Yeah, thank you".\c
{CHARA:r13}

{BLOCK:2}
"Anyway, good luck with the investigation, Sherlock junior!"@>
She winks.@ That's yet another of her mischievous quirks.@>
"Thanks."@>
{CHARA:r99}
Shinjo pats my shoulder as a sort of farewell gift and walks away through the hallway.@>
As I watch her leave, she stops five, maybe six meters away, and turns around to me.\c
{CHARA:r10}

{BLOCK:3}
"But, nothing is stopping me from investigating on my own, right?"@>
"Wha--?!"@>
{CHARA:r16}
I gasp unable to finish my sentence, and Shinjo chuckles as if making fun of me.@>
"I'm kidding!@ It was only a lil' joke!"@>
"S-Shinjo..."@>
"Anyway, bye-bye!"@>
{CHARA:r99}
Shinjo then keeps walking away with lively steps.\c

What she just said made my heart skip a beat.@>
I hope she's not serious about tagging along...@>
I definitely don't dislike her, but she's a very unpredictable girl.@>
She makes me feel anxious.#

{BLOCK:5}
But, leaving that aside, I obtained pretty valuable clues from Shinjo.@>
Now I know...@>
