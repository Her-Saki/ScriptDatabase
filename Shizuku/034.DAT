Judging by Shinjo's story, it seems we're dealing with a group of at least three girls.@ There could be more, though.@>
Keeping in mind I might run into them by accident, it's obviously beneficial to have a previous grasp of their numbers.#

{BLOCK:1}
So they're three or more, huh?@>
I wonder if that all-female group is really carrying out those orgies at school...@>
Does that mean Ohta was part of them?@>
It'd have been helpful if Shinjo observed them a little more closely...#

{BLOCK:2}
Anyway, even if they're only girls, I'd have a hard time brawling with three of them.@>
I'll try to avoid that scenario as much as I can.@>
I'm glad I was able to gather at least that piece of information.#
