After leaving Shinjo behind, I drop by classroom 2-A.@>
As we agreed, I'm going to meet Mizuho.@>
I grab a random student and ask them if she's in there, but they tell me she isn't.@>
Then, I remember what she told me before.#

{BLOCK:1}
"Whenever I'm not in the classroom, I stay at the student council."#

{BLOCK:2}
The student council, huh?@ Alright, I'm gonna head there.\c

{BLOCK:3}
Despite we know where the student council is inside the school, 90% of us students have never done so much as setting foot in it.@>
Aside from school festivals, the student council and their members are like a faint, elusive entity.@>
Regular students like us have no idea about half of what they do inside there.#

{BLOCK:4}
As long as they're given a certain degree of freedom, common students never complain.@>
It's merely their school life, so as long as someone takes care of their problems, they're fine.@ Instead of bothering themselves with the most tedious tasks, they choose the easy way.@>
The same applies to the national politics of our country.@>
That's why regular students have no concern regarding the student council.\c

{BLOCK:5}
At the endpoint of the row of cultural clubs lined up one next to each other, the nameplate labeled "Student Council" stands out quietly.@>
Club presidents often come and go, but aside from that, the room is always closed.#

{BLOCK:6}
I approach the door, but right before knocking, I immediately pull my hand back.@>
*Trac*@>
The very instant I'm about to tap it, the door opens first and hits my right hand.\c

{BLOCK:7}
"Oh, sorry, did I hurt you?"@>
A tall, young man shows his face from inside.@ I've never seen him before, but if I recall correctly, he was the student council president the previous semester.@>
His name is Tsukishima.@>
"N-No, it's nothing."#

{BLOCK:8}
"Alright, please take care of the rest."@>
{CHARA:r99}
Tsukishima tells to someone inside the room, and after apologizing again he walks away along the hallway.@>
Seniors are not required to come to school this time of year.@>
I wonder if he came because he has some important business to attend...@>
Can't he take a break from student council work now that his term ended?@>
Perhaps he's planning to visit Ohta in the hospital since she was the student council vice president.#

{BLOCK:9}
However, when I turn my gaze to him once more, he's nowhere to be seen.#
