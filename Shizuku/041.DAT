A clear sky spreads out in this comfortable twilight as the slightly fresh wind strokes our cheeks.@>
A single tree stands in the lawn extending all over the courtyard, and that's where we stop.\c

{BLOCK:1}
"You want to talk about letting me help you or not, correct?"@>
She asks peeking at my face.@>
"Um, yeah..."@>
{CHARA:r21}
"Please let me join!"@>
Realizing I falter as I talk, Mizuho demands to cooperate with a serious expression.@>
"I want to do something...@ Anything to help Kanako!"#

{BLOCK:2}
Mizuho stares at me with a fixed gaze.@>
She usually looks weak-willed, but she can become very intense once her emotions well up.@>
I'm at a loss for words and I don't know what to answer, but...@>
{CHARA:r24}
"Ah, sorry."@>
She apologizes and gives a step back, then slowly opens her mouth.#

{BLOCK:3}
"I already went to visit Kanako quite a lot of times."@>
Ohta has been admitted in a local hospital since Monday.@>
"At first they didn't let me visit her, but yesterday they allowed me to speak to her for a while."@>
"How was she?"@>
I'm concerned too.@ Not about Ohta, but about the post-traumatic state of someone who suffered a heavy mental breakdown.#

{BLOCK:4}
"Ohta has been sleeping since then.@ No, in fact, her eyes are open, but she keeps staring at the celing as quiet as if she were asleep."@>
Little by little, Mizuho's voice becomes a sob.@>
"No matter how much I call her name, Kanako never responds.@ Her mom tried to wake her up too, but to no avail."@>
"I see..."#

{BLOCK:5}
"The doctors told her mom she might stay like that forever."@>
{CHARA:r23}
Mizuho rubs both of her eyes as her slenders shoulders tremble.@>
I fail to find any appropriate words to soothe her.@>
"But maybe...@ just maybe...@ If I help in tonight's investigation, I could find a hint to open Kanako's heart.@ That's why I...@ I..."#

{BLOCK:6}
I see.@ Now I have a better grasp of the situation.@>
That's the reason why Mizuho wants to join the survey so badly.@>
If possible, I'd like to lend her a hand.@>
If, as she said, we can find a hint to help her regain consciousness, I'd like to discover it by all means possible.#

{BLOCK:7}
That said, bringing her to the survey is a different matter entirely.@>
I might as well just tell her everything I see later.@ Furthermore, right now she's too eager to help because she can't keep quiet about this.@>
What I should keep in mind to make my choice is if Mizuho will be useful for the investigation or not.\c
{CHARA:r21}

{BLOCK:8}
"Please, Yuusuke!"@>
"Wait a minute.@ There's something I'd like to ask you first.@ Please answer me."@>
{CHARA:r20}
"Oh, sure..."@>
Mizuho takes a breath.@ It seems she has calmed down now.#

{BLOCK:9}
What I want to ask her is...\n\e

{BLOCK:10}
{XPOS:6}
{SPEED:0}
1. About Ohta coming to school late at night.\n\e

{BLOCK:11}
{XPOS:6}
{SPEED:0}
2. If she noticed something strange in Ohta before the incident.\n\e
