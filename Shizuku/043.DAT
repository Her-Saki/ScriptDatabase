"I'd like you to tell me if you noticed something strange about Ohta before the incident."@>
{CHARA:r24}
"Well..."@>
Mizuho averts her gaze from me and hangs her head.@>
"I didn't notice Ohta was becoming insane until that very day.@ She looked to me like her usual self."#

{BLOCK:1}
{CHARA:r2A}
Mizuho bites her lower lip.@>
"I'm an idiot, aren't I?@ I'm supposed to be her best friend and I couldn't even notice those subtle changes in her..."@>
"Mizuho..."@>
{CHARA:r24}
"If only I realized it sooner, I'd have listened to her problems and helped her somehow.@ I'm sure she'd have never lost her mind that way..."#

{BLOCK:2}
Mizuho keeps facing down for a while.@>
I have no idea what to answer.@>
"I don't care if it's too late.@ I just want to do something for Kanako..."@>
Now I realize how much Mizuho cares about Ohta as a friend.@>
Well, perhaps Ohta was a girl worthy of such a strong friendship, and maybe she felt the same way about Mizuho.#

{BLOCK:3}
However, even if only temporarily, their bond has become toxic.@>
Despite how illogical it is, Mizuho feels guilty about her unability to save her before it was too late.@>
I bet she wants to free herself from her guilt during the few hours she'd be busy trying to help Ohta.#
