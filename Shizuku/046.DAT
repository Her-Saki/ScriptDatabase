{BLOCKLEN:12}

{BLOCK:0}
I understand painfully well how she feels about Ohta.@>
She suffered a mental breakdown and became unresponsive to any verbal stimulus, just like a human vegetable.@>
If there's no hope of recovery for her, she might as well be considered functionally dead.@>
Both the guilt she feels for not being able to prevent this incident and her wish to return her best friend to normal are urging Mizuho to join the survey.#

{BLOCK:1}
Perplexed by such an unexpected incident, she's confused about what to do.@ Even if only temporarily, Mizuho's beyond herself right now.@>
If there's really a culprit behind this crisis, and if she confronts them face to face, how would she react?@>
I can only imagine the worst case scenario.#

{BLOCK:2}
At the very least I can tell she's not ready to face this investigation.@>
That's what I feel, so I tell her directly:@>
"Yeah, I definitely can't take you with me."#

{BLOCK:3}
Upon hearing my statement, Mizuho's face becomes pale all of a sudden.@>
{CHARA:r21}
"Yuusuke!@ U-Umm..."@>
Unable to get out a coherent sentence, she presses me for a different answer.@>
{CHARA:r26}
"P-Please.@ I...@ I..."#

{BLOCK:4}
"No."@>
"Why?!"@>
"You're too emotional about Ohta right now."@>
{CHARA:r29}
"That's not true!@ I..."@>
Despite she denies it, she herself is aware that she's extremely anxious just as I pointed out, and cuts herself short while hanging her head in shame.\c
{CHARA:r24}
\e

{BLOCK:5}
"I'll inform you about everything I find out in the investigation without sparing any detail.@ Also, I promise you I won't miss any hint that could be useful to open Ohta's heart."@>
"......"@>
"Besides, it's not like the investigation will be only for tonight.@ If we have to keep patrolling for the next days, I'd like you to cooperate when that time comes."#

{BLOCK:6}
Mizuho gulps slowly the words that were about to leave her throat, and finally drops her shoulders as if she gave up.@>
"Please understand."@>
"......"@>
*Nod*@>
She nods with a docile expression.\c
{CHARA:r21}
\e

{BLOCK:7}
"Will you really keep that promise?"@>
"Absolutely."@>
"No matter how small of a detail, please tell me anything you find.@ Perhaps something among those clues is the key to return Kanako's mind to normal."@>
"Yes, I will."@>
{CHARA:r22}
"Okay."@>
Mizuho smiles sweetly and nods firmly once again.\c
{CHARA:r20}
\e

{BLOCK:8}
"Um, sorry, Yuusuke.@ I did nothing but bother you..."@>
"Don't worry, I asked you first, after all.@ Thanks to you, I obtained a lot of valuable hints.@ I appreciate it."@>
"N-No, I should be thanking you instead."@>
Mizuho shakes her head and then drops her gaze to the ground.@>
Then, she says glancing upwards at me:@>
{CHARA:r22}
"Anyway, I'll head back to the student council now.@ Good luck with the investigation.@ Please give it your best for me too...@ No, for Kanako."#

{BLOCK:9}
"Okay."@>
I give a strong nod.@>
{CHARA:r99}
Mizuho narrows her eyes smiling sweetly, and after giving a deep bow she takes her leave.#

{BLOCK:10}
Honestly, I'm surprised she gave up so easily.@>
Mizuho's so single-minded she sometimes becomes really obstinate.@>
I thought she wouldn't accept my rejection without complaining, but surprisingly, she obediently backed down.@ I'd even call it a bit disappointing.@>
Wait...@ She didn't feign acceptance knowing well I'd never change my mind... right?#

{BLOCK:11}
Holding a tad of anxiety in my heart, I observe her slender back as she leaves.@>
When she's about to exit the courtyard, Mizuho looks back at me once more and does a little farewell gesture.@>
In turn, I say goodbye waving a hand.#
