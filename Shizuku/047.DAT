In order to meet Ruriko, I climb the stairs that lead to the rooftop.@>
After walking upstairs through the steel-cold, gray steps, I unlock the heavy iron door which was already slightly opened.#

{BLOCK:1}
I'm sure she's there.@>
She'll welcome me with an empty smile as the bright-red, sepia-colored sun looms behind her, her fine hair streaming in the wind.@>
I have no doubt she's there.@>
I don't know why, but strangely, I'm absolutely certain of it.\c

{BLOCK:2}
After leaving Mizuho behind, I headed immediately to Ruriko's classroom to pay her a visit.@>
However, she was not there.@>
She couldn't possibly have gone home, so I thought she was somewhere in the school.@>
After all, her bag was still on her desk.#

{BLOCK:3}
I asked Ruriko's whereabouts to a student in the classroom.@>
"Tsukishima?@ Ah, you mean that crazy bitch?"@>
That was the very first thing he said.@>
It's evident her classmates are keeping her at arm's lenght.#

{BLOCK:4}
She was never a chatterbox to begin with, but since last year's fall she stopped talking with everyone almost completely.@>
Apparently, a certain day she cut ties with her close friends out of the blue, becoming basically a recluse.@>
Whenever they tried to talk with her she took the conversation to electromagnetic waves, signals and that kind of stuff, making it clear that she was not all there.#

{BLOCK:5}
Just like with Ohta, rumors started to spread that the cause of her insanity was stress, psychosis, drugs, etc.@>
However, since her symptoms were far less serious than Ohta's, she could still attend school normally.@>
She spooked everyone around her with her obscure behavior, but nothing more scandalous than that.\c
{BG:470505}
\e

{BLOCK:6}
Ruriko cut all form of communication with the people around her.@>
She closed her heart and broke relationships even with her best friends.@>
However, she wasn't like that when I met her earlier today.\c
{CHABG:r00310505}

{BLOCK:7}
When we happened on the rooftop, she talked with me relaxedly and smiled all the time.@>
She didn't give me the impression of a lonely girl at all.@>
Back then she seemed like she just wanted to conversate with someone for a change.@>
No, that's not quite right.@>
Why, then?#

{BLOCK:8}
"You're just like me, aren't you, Nagase?"#

{BLOCK:9}
That's what she said.@ She stated that we were alike.@>
She said that because I'm indeed similar to her...@ No, I'm not sure about that, but at least I'm sure one of the reasons why she opened her heart to me is because she THINKS we're on the same wavelenght.@>
That's what I feel.@>
If that's the case, why does she think about me as a friend?#

{BLOCK:10}
"You can receive electromagnetic waves, can't you?"#

{BLOCK:11}
Ruriko was talking about radio waves' reception.@>
To be honest, I don't have that kind of power.@>
Not only that: I don't even understand the concept behind the waves she mentioned.@>
As far as that matter goes, I can only conclude it's a misunderstanding on her part.#

{BLOCK:12}
Nonetheless, I consider her a friend as well.@>
That's because...#

{BLOCK:13}
She opened the door towards the world of insanity.#

{BLOCK:14}
I'm ABOUT to open it too.@>
Ohta, on the other hand, opened it BY ACCIDENT.@>
What about Ruriko, then?@>
How far did she go into that world after opening the door...?\c
{BG:550505}
\e

{BLOCK:15}
As I ponder about that, I find myself already on the last step of the stairs.@>
Before me is the heavy-looking, gray iron door that leads to the rooftop.@>
It's unlocked.@>
The light of the deep-red sun leaks through the small gap between the door and the outside.#

{BLOCK:16}
I open the door.@>
{BG:351010}
The setting sun spreading through the sky tints the urban landscape below my gaze with a reddish sepia hue.@>
The contrast between the sun, the shadows and the vibrant crimson sunlight stings my eyes.#

{BLOCK:17}
A black shadow stands in front of the bright-red sun as if melted with it, and I slowly approach it.\c

{VISUAL:030000}
\e

{BLOCK:18}
Ruriko is staring fixedly at the door, just as if she knew I'd come to visit her.@>
The cold wind sways the thin strands of her hair and the hem of her uniform.#

{BLOCK:19}
Just as I thought,@>
she's waiting for me with an empty smile on her face.#
