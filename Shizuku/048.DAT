In the red sunset sky, a sun akin to a blistering hot furnace projects our shadows sharply on the concrete floor.@>
Both of our shadows cast by low-angled sunrays extend a long way from our feet, joining at the end and overlapping each other.#

{BLOCK:1}
This crimson sky reminds me of amber-hot metal melting in a furnace, fireworks, or sparklers.@>
It's a dull, beautiful red.@>
A color befitting of Ruriko, who possess both the innocence of a young maiden and the insanity of a lunatic.#

{BLOCK:2}
Ruriko rests against the fence as she gazes at me.@>
Holding down her hair with a hand, she narrows her eyes slowly and then cracks a gentle smile.@>
"You finally came."@>
I stop on my tracks.@>
"Me?"@>
"Yes.@ I was calling you all this time."@>
A world dyed red.@>
Her hair, skin, uniform, eyes, nose, mouth, nails...@>
All of it colored with a charming, muddy crimson tint.#

{BLOCK:3}
"You called me?"@>
"Yep.@ I was telling you to hurry up."@>
She says as the immaculate smile of a childish lady appears on her face.@>
"Did they reach you?"@>
"Huh?@ What?"@>
"The electromagnetic waves."@>
"Electromagnetic...?@ O-Oh, you mean THOSE waves, right?"@>
I recall the conversation I had with her earlier today.#

{BLOCK:4}
"I sent you a message with my waves.@ Have you received it?"@>
"A message...?"@>
Ruriko never stops smiling.@>
I have no idea if she's serious or if she's just pulling my leg.#
