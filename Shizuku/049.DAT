{BLOCK:0}
"Sorry, but I didn't receive anything.@ I only came here by chance."@>
I answer honestly.#

{BLOCK:1}
"Ruriko, earlier today I told you that I don't have the power to perceive electromagnetic waves or anything like that."@>
I'm starting to feel sorry for her.@>
Perhaps this is merely a delusion that lives exclusively in her mind, but I feel bitter about not being able to share her world because I still feel a strange affinity towards her.#

{BLOCK:2}
I turn my eyes upwards and look at Ruriko.@>
Despite my confession, her eyes still look as gentle as always.@>
I feel those deep eyes, akin to an ocean by night, could engulf the entirety of the sinister darkness dwelling inside me.@>
"But you CAME here, right?@ That proves my waves actually reached you."@>
Ruriko says.#

{BLOCK:3}
"Yeah, perhaps that's so."@>
I want to believe it too.@>
I'd be happy to know I came here lured by Ruriko's mysterious invitation.@>
Ruriko lifts up her body from the fence, and cracking a little giggle, she walks leisurely towards me.#

{BLOCK:4}
"You'll soon understand everything."@>
"!"@>

{VISUAL:020505}
Along with that whisper, she overlaps her body on mine and holds my head between her slender arms, stroking gently my nape with her cold hands.@>
I'm unable to hide my bewilderment before her sudden actions.#

{BLOCK:5}
Ruriko sinks her head in my chest and stops moving.@>
Her face is so lovely...@ I could touch her lips just by reaching out my fingers a little.@>
Time passes ever so slowly.@>
Her thin hair fluttering in the wind tickles my cheeks playfully, and her perfectly rhythmical hearbeats travel to me like ripples from the soft mounds on her chest pressed against mine.#

{BLOCK:6}
In contrast to my burning-hot body, Ruriko's one is completely cold as she receives the chilly wind blowing past her.@>
"Your body feels cold, Ruriko."@>
"But yours is warm..."@>
It feels like two conflicting sources of energy gradually merging with each other, like an iceberg floating in hot water.#

{BLOCK:7}
Her pleasant scent entices me to a sleep-inducing peace of mind.@>
Ruriko...#

{BLOCK:8}
"Feel it..."@>
She mutters as she moves her face so close to me that I can feel her breath.@>
Her respiration tickles my nape.@>
"Huh...?"@>
"My electric particles...@ I become an antenna...@ and gather those mysterious particles floating in the air..."@>
"R-Ruriko...?"\c

{BLOCK:9}
Next thing I know, the world bends as easily as if made of rubber.@>

{BLOCK:10}
{VISUAL:020505}
All of a sudden, my heart starts pounding as heavily as an alarm bell, and blood runs through my body with the force of a broken dam.@>
"W-What's going on...?"@>
Static runs across my brain.@ It feels like electricity particles are flowing across it...@>
The physical illusion of a plethora of hot elements gathering inside my body makes me break a sweat.@>
My body feels hot...@ As hot as burning flames.@>
On the contrary, Ruriko's body feels as strikingly cold as ice.#

{BLOCK:11}
"Everything is bright red..."@>
Ruriko looks up to the sky.@>
The electric current running across my brain goes beyond mere biting and becomes painful.@>
My whole body gets covered in sweat as nausea wells up in my throat.@>
"R-Ruriko...@ I'm...@ not..."@>
However, Ruriko just keeps staring at the sky.#

{BLOCK:12}
"The red color of a twilight...@ Of metal melting in a furnace and turning amber...@ Of fireworks...@ Of sparklers...@ A beautiful, dull red."@>
"I'm not...@ feeling well..."@>
"And also...@ the red color of the flames of a nuke."#

{BLOCK:13}
"W-What are you doing, Ruriko...?"@>
"A new type of nuke that can burn and destroy a planet with dark red colored, magnificent blazes..."@>
"R-Ruriko..."@>
"Crimson flames...@ People running away...@ Burning, scorching, deadly heat..."@>
"!"#

{BLOCK:14}
"Their bodies rot and decay...@ Their ears and fingers decompose and fall apart as they cry in anguish and pain..."@>
SOMETHING grazes the back of my brain, and as soon as that happens, I gulp saliva.@>
What a strange scene...@>
Holding me in her arms, Ruriko keeps delivering her bizarre speech while staring at a fixed point in the sky.@>
Strange?@>
What am I even saying?@ This is...#

{BLOCK:15}
"Despite they're burning, hurting and out of breath, people think only of themselves, trample on others and drag them away, despite their limbs are rotting all the same..."#

{BLOCK:16}
This is my own world.#

{BLOCK:17}
My sticky dreams...@>
The fantasies I envision during class...@>
My own Earth I use to drawing on a white page in my notebook...@>
That new type of nuke that burns it down until no traces of it remain...#

{BLOCK:18}
How...?@>
How does Ruriko know about my world of delusions...?#

{BLOCK:19}
{FLASH}
The electric current biting my brain becomes more copious,@>
my body goes numb,@>
and the zone between my eyebrows gets hotter.@>
"Ru-Ru-Ru-Ru...@ ri-ri-ri-ri...@ ko-ko-ko-ko..."@>
My field of vision warps like a broken 8mm film.@>
Lost in thought, I embrace Ruriko back and sink my face into her soft bosom.#

{BLOCK:20}
Something cold leaks down my cheek.@>
Before I realize it, tears spill from my eyes.#

{BLOCK:21}
And eventually, I lose consciousness.\c
