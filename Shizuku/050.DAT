"Yeah, your electromagnetic waves reached my head; the message you sent with them led me here."@>
I play along with her prank.@>
"Really?"@>
Ruriko looks at me doubtfully.@>
"Y-Yeah, it's true.@ I received your waves loud and clear."@>
I keep going, though perhaps I'm taking this a bit too far.#

{BLOCK:1}
"Is it some kind of telepathic power?@ I mean, I heard your voice.@ I came here because I felt I HAD to meet you."@>
I'm aware I'm just talking nonsense.@>
Actually, I didn't perceive those electromagnetic waves at all.@>
I just want to talk with Ruriko about these strange things because I feel I could get closer to her that way.#

{BLOCK:2}
"So you can use electromagnetic waves now, right, Naga?"@>
Ruriko says tilting her head.@>
"Uh...@ Y-Yeah."@>
"I KNEW we were alike."@>
"S-Sure we are..."@>
I just wanted to pull her leg, but seeing her sincere smile makes me feel guilty.#

{BLOCK:3}
"If that's the case, feel this..."@>
She whispers as she approaches a step closer.@>
Her silky hair flutters in the wind.@>
"Huh?"@>
"My waves are not verbal, but visual."@>
Ruriko narrows her eyes.@>
"H-Hold on, R-Ruriko..."\c

{BLOCK:4}
Next thing I know, the world bends as easily as if made of rubber.@>

{BLOCK:5}
{VISUAL:021100}
All of a sudden, my heart starts pounding as heavily as an alarm bell, and blood runs through my body with the force of a broken dam.@>
"W-What's going on...?"@>
My brain tickles.@ It feels like electricity particles are flowing across it...@>
The physical illusion of a plethora of hot elements gathering inside my body makes me break a sweat.@>
My body feels hot...@ As hot as burning flames.#

{BLOCK:6}
"My electromagnetic waves are traveling inside you, aren't they?"@>
Ruriko looks intently at me.@>
The current running through my brain goes beyond tickling and now stings.@>
My whole body is covered in sweat, and I feel like vomiting.@>
"W-Wait, Ruriko.@ I..."@>
However, she stays frozen in place, without answering anything.#

{BLOCK:7}
{FLASH}
I feel the amount of current biting my brain suddenly increased, and I shiver as the area between my eyebrows gets hotter.@>
"Ru-Ru-Ru-Ru...@ ri-ri-ri-ri...@ ko-ko-ko-ko..."@>
My field of vision starts to shake like a broken 8mm film.@>
Forgetting myself, I approach Ruriko and cling to her.#

{BLOCK:8}
I can't believe it.@ Are these Ruriko's electromagnetic waves?@>
Something cold wets my cheek.@>
Without even realizing it, I find myself crying my eyes away.#

{BLOCK:9}
And eventually, I lose conciousness.\c
