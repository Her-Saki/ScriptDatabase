{BLOCK:0}
A full, round moon hangs up in the sky.@>
Illuminated by its faint moonlight, our bodies shine like pale flames, and our shadows at our feet are sharply projected under that light.@>
I don't know why, but this scene looks very mystic to me.\c

{BLOCK:1}
I'm resting against Ruriko's chest.@>
She closes her eyes slightly, and completely silent, she hugs my head.@>
The calm sound of her breath...@ Her heartbeats...@ The quiet motions of her chest...@ Her body temperature...@ Her sighs...@>
The solid presence of Ruriko entices me to a sleep-inducing relief.@>
A sense of comfort envelops me, like a kid embraced by his mother.#

{BLOCK:2}
"Ruriko..."@>
I call her name faintly with my face sunk into her soft bosom, and she slowly turns around to look at me.@>
"Why me?"@>
I ask, but Ruriko's body doesn't exhibit the slightest response.@>
"We shared class last year, but after we were promoted to somophores, we stopped seeing each other completely.@ No...@ I think even back then you didn't even know I existed."#

{BLOCK:3}
She's a hard-to-approach Venus, and on top of that, she's always reading books.@>
A very quiet girl, indeed.@>
If she were a character from an old classical novel, she'd be most accurately described as a closeted maiden.@>
She was like an idol for the boys of our class, and that's why I never really talked to her.@>

{BLOCK:4}
"Those messages via electromagnetic waves...@ Why did you send them to me?@ Is there a reason why you chose me?"@>
I lift my face from her chest.@>
That small question has been bugging me in a corner of my mind.@>
Up until just recently, I wouldn't have minded ANY answer from her.@>
I thought those answers themselves bore no meaning both for me and her.#

{BLOCK:5}
But now...@ Now things are different.@>
Little by little, that doubt has been growing bigger and bigger in my heart along with my feelings for her, and it eventually became so relevant I can't ignore it anymore.@>
Why is Ruriko so nice to me?@>
Is it because it's ME?@>
Or could it be because...?@>
I can't stop asking myself those questions.#

{BLOCK:6}
Ruriko cracks her usual languid smile, and after a brief silence, she slowly opens her mouth.@>
"Naga..."@>
"Huh?"@>
"You...@ called for me."@>
"What?@ Me?"@>
I blink two, three times.@>
"You asked me for help every single day.@ "Please save me!", you said."@>
"What do you mean...?"#

{BLOCK:7}
Ruriko embraces me strongly.@>
"You were crying like a kid, like "I'm going to disappear!" and stuff.@ Those messages acquired the form of electromagnetic waves and I caught wind of them."@>
"Me?@ Disappearing?"@>
"Yes, I received those messages every day."@>
"......"#

{BLOCK:8}
That I'm about to disappear?@>
ME?@>
How come?@>
That I was crying every day?@>
Why would I be so depressed...?#

{BLOCK:9}
However, I've known the answer from long ago.@>
I know that better that anybody else.#

{BLOCK:10}
My existence was about to disappear from the real world.#

{BLOCK:11}
I had the strange feeling that the same film looped every single day at exactly the same hour.@>
A repetitive everyday where nothing ever changed in the picture.@>
And eventually, I noticed all the color from the world vanished.#

{BLOCK:12}
Trapped in that world, I was crying all alone.@>
I cried like a kid and shouted that I was about to disappear, so I looked for someone else, a stranger, to help me.#

{BLOCK:13}
"That's why I thought I'd help you."@>
Ruriko's snowy, cold hand gently strokes my back.@>
"I'll save you.@ I promise I'll save you, Naga."@>
"Ruriko..."@>
"So... don't cry anymore, okay?"@>
Ruriko says peeking at my face.@>
Eyes unfocused like a lake under a moon night.@>
The eyes of a person whose spirit broke down.#

{BLOCK:14}
"How strange.@ So you always knew everything about me..."@>
Just a few hours before we were only classmates that conversed every now and then...@>
"My voice reached you, didn't it, Ruriko?"@>
Yeah, and your voice reached my mind, too.#

{BLOCK:15}
Ruriko cowering and quivering...@>
Her teardrops flowing down her cheeks...@>
The light ripples spreading through the puddle...#

{BLOCK:16}
That's Ruriko's inner world.@>
The voice of her heart.#

{BLOCK:17}
"You said before that we were alike, but I think I know what you meant now."@>
Ruriko keeps looking at me, always smiling.@>
"Please save me, Ruriko, because I'll save you too..."@>
"Yes..."#

{BLOCK:18}
Golden moonlight illuminates both of us.@>
We embrace each other like two inanimate objects as we feel mutually our breath.\c
