Ruriko's by my side.@>
We stayed together in the rooftop since then, just the two of us.@>
It's not like we did anything special.@ We just let time pass quietly, embracing each other without muttering a word.#

{BLOCK:1}
But eventually, it becomes time to kick off the investigation.#

{BLOCK:2}
Ruriko decides to join the survey as if it were the most natural in the world, and curiosly, I accept it as a matter of fact too.@>
I can't deny I rejected Shinjo and Mizuho over preference for Ruriko.@>
This investigation is indeed dangerous, and it could turn problematic if we stay up too late.@>
Also, if Ruriko finds herself in danger, I'm not sure if I'll be able to protect her.#

{BLOCK:3}
That said, I can't stop thinking that she has something to do with this incident.@>
It's just a baseless conjecture, but I think she knows something important that she'll tell me when the right time comes.@>
That's why I chose to take her along.#

{BLOCK:4}
No, actually, there's a reason more important than that...@>
Just as I am now, I need her more than anything in the world.@>
Her thin hair, her pale skin, her comfy chest...@ I want her and everything that defines her by my side.@>
To say all the truth, those feelings weight more in my decision than anything else.#
