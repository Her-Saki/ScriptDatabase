It was a strange experience.@>
I wonder if it was some sort of sleep paralysis...@>
Despite my mind was as sharp as a knife, I had lost all freedom in my body.@>
Was Ruriko behind it?@>
First the electricity rushing inside my head, and now this...@ Is Ruriko really able to use electromagnetic waves?@>
Was she the one who paralyzed me?#

{BLOCK:1}
This is so silly...@ It's not like we're in a sci-fi movie or anything.@>
Am I supposed to believe toxic electromagnetic waves are pouring down from outer space?@>
I smile at my own foolishness.@>
My body just froze unconsciously after being treated so coldly by Ruriko.@>
Without a doubt, deep in my heart I hesitated to chase Ruriko back there.@>
Her teardrops themselves froze my body.#

{BLOCK:2}
As I ponder about that, it finally becomes time to run the survey.#

{BLOCK:3}
I'm worried about Ruriko, but despite I look for her everywhere, I can't find her.@>
My plan to bring her along flopped spectacularly.@>
Appartenly Ruriko thinks I was making fun of electromagnetic waves.@>
That wasn't my intention...@>
Perhaps I took my joke too far...#
