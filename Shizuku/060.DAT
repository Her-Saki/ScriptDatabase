Based on Shinjo's testimony, I patrol near the second gym.@>
The second gym is the newest one and is used by the volleyball club, which is known for being one of the strongest teams in the prefecture.@ They always stay up late training.@>
That said, there's not a soul to be found at this time of night.#

{BLOCK:1}
The light from the full, round moon is so bright it projects every shadow sharply on the floor, and thanks to that, I can see very far away without relying on any other light source.@>
Cherry trees line up around the gym.@>
For now, I just walk along it.@>
I make sure I don't miss any shadow or lit spot, but in the end, I don't find anything.#

{BLOCK:2}
Next I enter the gym.@>
The door is locked.@>
I insert the master key my uncle gave me.@>
However, the key doesn't work.@>
Apparently, this key only works inside the school building, which the gym doesn't belong to.@>
My search range narrowed a little, but there's hardly anything I can do about it.@>
If the investigation continues until tomorrow, I'll ask for this key to my uncle.#
