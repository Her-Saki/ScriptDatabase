Hold up.@>
Shinjo said the club members leave the gym key next to a notebook every time they exit it.#

{BLOCK:1}
I look around.@>
There's a janitor room with small glass windows.@>
I open the unlocked door.@>
{BG:000311}
After taking a look inside, I find several keys hanging in a wall.@>
The notebook is on the desk below.@>
I take it up and flip through the pages.#

{BLOCK:2}
In the last row of the last page is written:@>
"March 6, 8:35 P.M, female volleyball club, Shinjo".@>
It seems the last person to leave today was Shinjo.@>
I put the notebook back in the desk and take the 2nd gym's key labeled as such.#

{BLOCK:3}
I open the gym door with that key.@>
{BG:521103}
The inside is dark.@ Only the moon illuminates it faintly from the window.@>
Everything is dead silent, and there's nobody around to be seen.#

{BLOCK:4}
We enter...@>
{BG:270303}
the changing room,
{BG:530303}
the toilet,
{BG:260303}
the equipment room,
{BG:520303}
and the guidance room, but despite patrolling thoroughly, we find nothing of interest.#

{BLOCK:5}
It seems nothing weird is going on the 2nd gym...#
