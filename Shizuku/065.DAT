We're in front of the 2nd gym.#

{BLOCK:1}
We didn't find a single clue yet.@>
Perhaps we're patrolling the wrong places?@>
That said, as long as the culprits doesn't show themselves, we don't have a choice but to walk around and investigate straightforwardly.#

{BLOCK:2}
Should we go for an exhaustive search?@>
{CHARA:r02}
As I think about that, I casually peek at Ruriko's face.@>
She's wearing a complex expression as she stares fixedly at the school building.#

{BLOCK:3}
"What are you looking at, Ruriko?"@>
{CHARA:r00}
I ask her, and she stares back at me.@>
"What's wrong?"@>
{CHARA:r02}
She slowly reaches out her right arm horizontally, and points to the building.@>
"There are people over there."@>
She says with an expressionless, emotionless face.#

{BLOCK:4}
"People?!"@>
I turn my gaze to where she pointed.@>
And there...@>
{BGMSTOP}
"!"@>
Yeah, they're there!@>
They immediately vanished from our field of vision, but they WERE there.@>
Two persons even.@>
"Let's go!"\c
{REFCHAR:r99}
{BGMPLAY:05}

{BLOCK:5}
Both shadows crossed the back of the gym and disappeared into the building.@>
We run and chase them right away.@>
That said, we walk step by step carefully as to not being noticed...#

{BLOCK:6}
We reach them in no time.@>
It looks like the shadows want to enter the building from the emergency exit by the east stairs.@>
When they open the door with the key, they get spotlighted by the moonlight and their appearances become clear.#

{BLOCK:7}
At first I thought one of them was hiding their face, and thus their gender, behind a mask.@>
However, looking at them closely, I notice it isn't a mask, but a piece of white fabric.@>
White bandages, to be precise.@>
They have their face covered with white bandages, like a mummy from a horror movie.#

{BLOCK:8}
Then, I see the other one under the moonlight.@>
"!"@>
I let out an unintentional gasp.@>
I know that face...@>
Slightly curly, chestnut-color hair...@ Big glasses...@ A somewhat childish face...@>
She's the student council's secretary, Mizuho Aihara.#

{BLOCK:9}
Mizuho...@>
Yeah, I have no doubt it's her.#

{BLOCK:10}
I can't believe she really came...@>
I was kinda expecting it, but I regret not stopping her before.@>
Who is the person next to her?@ A friend of hers she brought along?@>
That's fine, but what if she's a member of the meetings...?@>
Alcohol...@ Drugs...@ Sex...@ Rape...@>
Those nouns my uncle mentioned flash through my mind and make my spine chill.#

{BLOCK:11}
"Mizu--...!"@>
I run over to Mizuho, but Ruriko's cold hand grabs mine.@>
{CHARA:r01}
"Don't go."@>
When I turn around, Ruriko's gazing fixedly at me.@>
"You can't go now."@>
She doesn't let go of my hand.@>
B-But...#

{BLOCK:12}
I turn my gaze to the emergency exit.@>
Mizuho and the other person are about to enter the building.#

{BLOCK:13}
What should I do?\n\e

{BLOCK:14}
{XPOS:6}
{SPEED:0}
1. I must stop Mizuho\n\e

{BLOCK:15}
{XPOS:6}
{SPEED:0}
2. I'm worried about Mizuho, but for now I'll watch from afar.\n\e
