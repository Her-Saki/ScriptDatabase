I'm in front of the second gym.#

{BLOCK:1}
I haven't found a single clue yet.@>
Perhaps I've been patrolling the wrong places?@>
That said, as long as the culprits don't show themselves, I have no choice but to walk around and investigate straightforwardly.#
Should I aim for an exhaustive search?#

{BLOCK:2}
However, at that moment...@>
{BGMSTOP}
"!"@>
Although they vanished immediately from my field of vision, I spotted a couple of human-like shadows illuminated by the moonlight in the distance.#

{BLOCK:3}
There were two persons.@>
Perhaps they're the people I'm looking for.@>
They cross the back of the gym and disappear into the building.@>
I chase them back right away, but walking step by step in order to avoid being noticed.#

{BLOCK:4}
{BGMPLAY:05}
I wasn't wrong.@>
There's two human-like shadows there.@>
I reach them in no time.@>
It seems they're trying to enter the building from the emergency exit by the east stairs.@>
After they open the door with the key, they come into view under the moonlight.#

{BLOCK:5}
At first I thought one of them was hiding their face, and thus their gender, behind a mask.@>
However, looking at them closely, I notice it isn't a mask, but a piece of white fabric.@>
White bandages, to be precise.@>
They have their face covered with white bandages, like a mummy from a horror movie.#

{BLOCK:6}
Then, I see the other one under the moonlight.@>
"!"@>
I let out an unintentional gasp.@>
I know that face...@>
Slightly curly, chestnut-color hair...@ Big glasses...@ A somewhat childish face...@>
She's the student council's secretary, Mizuho Aihara.#

{BLOCK:7}
Mizuho...@>
Yeah, no doubt it's her.#

{BLOCK:8}
I can't believe she really came...@>
I was kinda expecting it, but I regret not stopping her before.@>
Who is the person next to her?@ A friend of hers she brought along?@>
That's fine, but what if she's a member of the meetings...?@>
Alcohol...@ Drugs...@ Sex...@ Rape...@>
Those nouns my uncle mentioned flash through my mind and send chills through my spine.#

{BLOCK:9}
Mizuho and the other person are about to enter the building.@>
I gotta save her!\c
