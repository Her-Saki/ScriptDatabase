Certainly, it wouldn't be wise to come out now.@>
I should assess the situation for a while longer.@>
All the more logical if the person next to Mizuho is a member of the offenders' group.@>
If I take action now, not only they'd notice me, but I'd be putting Mizuho in danger, and perhaps even Ruriko as well.#

{BLOCK:1}
My ultimate goal is to run the survey, not confronting them face to face.@>
Of course, if I judge Mizuho's in danger, I'll go rescue her immediately.@>
However, that doesn't seem to be the case.@>
Anyway, for now, I'll just watch over her.#

{BLOCK:2}
"Fine.@ I won't go."@>
I say, and Ruriko slowly lets go of my hand.@>
{CHARA:r00}
She's staring at me with an unfocused gaze.@>
Why did she stop me?@>
Did she analyze the situation calmly?@ Did she think I was being reckless?@ Did she feel herself in danger?@ Or... is she concerned about me?@>
I don't think she would answer those questions if I asked her.#

When I point my gaze to the building, Mizuho and the other person already entered the building.@>
I take a look around, and after making sure no shadow is around, I slowly approach the emergency exit.#
