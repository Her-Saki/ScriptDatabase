Why did she stop me?@>
Did she analyze the situation calmly?@ Did she think I was being reckless?@ Did she feel herself in danger?@ Or... is she concerned about me?@>
I don't think she would answer those questions if I asked her.#

{BLOCK:1}
"There's a girl I know there.@ I want to talk with her."@>
I say, and Ruriko slowly lets go of my hand.@>
However, she keeps staring at me with a slightly troubled expression.#

{BLOCK:2}
"The most logical course of action now would be tailing them, but I can't let that girl be exposed to danger."@>
Ruriko keeps silent without answering anything.@>
"Stay hidden here, Ruriko.@ If you see yourself in danger, forget about me and run.@ Got it?"#

{BLOCK:3}
With those parting words, I leave Ruriko behind as she keeps staring intently (and silently) at me.\c
