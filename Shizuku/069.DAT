Where did Mizuho go?@>
It must be a place relatively close to the emergency exit...#

{BLOCK:1}
{FLASH}
Right then, along with the scratchy touch of electric current, the name of a certain room pops up in a corner of my mind.@>
The student council.@>
Of course...@>
That room is literally around the corner.@>
It's very likely that Mizuho headed there, since she's a member of the council.\c

{BLOCK:2}
As I lead Ruriko by the hand, we go around the backdoor of the school building.@>
There's a parking lot for bikes there.@>
After cutting across a narrow gap from that place, we can get out to a courtyard surrounded by the school's buildings.@>
If memory serves me right, that breach barely allows a single person to pass through, but in the middle there's a window to the student council's room.@>
We cross that slender crack and move in front of the window.\c
{BG:161103}
\e

{BLOCK:3}
The window is covered with a black curtain, and I can't even tell if the fluorescent lamps are turned on inside.@>
Worse even, the window frame is firmly enveloped in aluminium sash, thus not allowing any sound to leak out.@>
I put my ear against the window and listen closely.#

{BLOCK:4}
"!"@>
{BGMPLAY:09}
Although faintly, I can hear people conversing inside.@>
I don't know what they're talking about behind this glass window, but it sounds like girls' voices.@>
I think I hear Mizuho's voice there...@>
and the voice of another girl, too.@>
Their voices sound strange, as if they're not holding a conversation at all.@ Like animal groans, but "feminine".@>
Are those girls... gasping?#

{BLOCK:5}
Whatever the case may be, I'm certain there are people inside the room.@ Two girls, at least.@>
Unfortunately, I have no idea what they're doing.@>
Nonetheless, I hear what it seems to be Mizuho's voice shouting something.#

{BLOCK:6}
At that moment, I hear a male voice among the girls' ones.@>
Are there three of them?@>
I thought so at first, but now I hear an anguish cry along with the laugh of the man.@>
I hear gasps, too.@>
He's not alone.@>
There's at least two persons more inside.#

{BLOCK:7}
What the hell are they doing in there?@>
I'm not sure how accurate my uncle's theory was, but it seems he wasn't too off the mark.@>
Mizuho must be witnessing something unspeakable inside.#

{BLOCK:8}
This is no good.@>
I'm not getting anywhere staying here.@>
When I separate my ear from the glass window, I feel it slides slightly.@>
No way...!@>
I touch the window carefully and apply force in my fingertips.@>
Then, the window slides smoothly to one side.@>
It's not locked!#

{BLOCK:9}
I don't know if it's just a coincidence or if it's open on purpose, but either way, I'm lucky.@>
Making sure that the curtains don't get swayed by the wind, I quietly open the window without making any sound.#

{BLOCK:10}
And then, as if suddenly turning up the volume of a TV, I hear the voices from inside loud and clear.@>
"Stop, Kanako!"@>
Just as I thought, it was Mizuho.@>
That is, undoubtedly, her voice.@>
She's definitely inside there.#

{BLOCK:11}
Mizuho just screamed "Kanako".@>
Kanako...?@>
Does she mean THAT Kanako Ohta?@>
Is she inside that room now?!@>
I carefully open the black curtain with a finger in order to get a peek inside, and there...#
