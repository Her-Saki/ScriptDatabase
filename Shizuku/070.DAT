{BLOCK:0}
After opening the emergency exit, Mizuho and the other person enter the building.@>
It'd be bad if they closed the door and locked themselves inside.@>
"Mizuho!"@>
I run to chase them while shouting Mizuho's name at the top of my lungs.@>
She reacts surprisedly to my voice, and turns around.\c
{CHARA:r21}
\e

{BLOCK:1}
"Yuusuke!"@>
Mizuho stops in her tracks and covers her mouth with her hand.@>
The bandaged man next to her switfly steps in between us.@>
Under the yellow moonlight, his appearance becomes clear.@>
The bits of his face revealed behind all the gauze look... unmistakably female.@>
Scars are carved on his cheeks, which are painful to look at.@>
Those injuries...@ Don't tell me it's actually...#

{BLOCK:2}
After approaching him, I confirm my suspicions.@>
There's no mistake.@>
The bandaged man...@ No, the bandaged girl is...\c

{BLOCK:3}
Ohta.#

{BLOCK:4}
Kanako Ohta.@>
The student council's vice president, my classmate, and Mizuho's irreplaceable best friend.@>
Three days ago she harmed herself scratching her cheeks with her own nails, thus causing those painful wounds.@>
If Ohta's here, does that mean my uncle's speculation wasn't wrong after all?#

{BLOCK:5}
After snapping mid-class out of the blue, she was carried to a hospital in an ambulance and, supposedly, remained hospitalized up until now.@ How come she's here now?@>
Did she escape?@>
That doesn't sound too far-fetched.#

{BLOCK:6}
In her diary, Ohta presented a pathological sexual desire, akin to a drug addict craving illicit substances.@>
Now that she operates on mere instinct after losing her mind, perhaps it's only natural she'd come here.#

{BLOCK:7}
Ohta's eyes are just like they were three days ago.@>
Unfocused and cloudy like a muddy swamp under a moon night.@>
The eyes of a person who suffered a mental breakdown.@>
The same eyes Ruriko possess.#

{BLOCK:8}
With a broad smile on her face, she stares at me moving her head as clumsily as a busted robot.@>
A chill races up my spine.@>
Her gaze is as cold as ice.@>
Once I reach both of them, I pass before Ohta to avoid her gaze, and then grab Mizuho's slender shoulders.#

{BLOCK:9}
"Mizuho!"@>
{CHARA:r24}
"Y-Yuu...@ suke..."@>
Mizuho makes the most awkward face I could ever describe, and drops her gaze to the floor.@>
"You promised me you wouldn't come!"@>
"S-Sorry.@ I-I was so worried about Kanako that...@ Well..."#

{BLOCK:10}
"For starters, why is Ohta with you?"@>
{CHARA:r21}
"I went looking for you ready to be scolded, and by chance...@ I mean, literally by chance, I met Kanako.@ It seems she has escaped from the hospital..."@>
I give a fleeting glance at Ohta.@>
She stares back at us with a wide grin.@>
I get goosebumps, and a chill runs down my spine.@>
She doesn't look like a living human being.@>
Nonsensical thoughts like that cross through my mind.#

{BLOCK:11}
"O-Ohta...@ Did you escape from the hospital?"@>
I ask, but she doesn't answer at all.@>
{CHARA:r24}
"It's useless to talk to Kanako as she is now.@ She doesn't listen to a word I say either."@>
Mizuho hangs her head with a melancholic face.@>
"Really?"@>
With muddy, cloudy eyes, Ohta glares at us as she curls her lips.#

{BLOCK:12}
"It looks like she's not her usual self."@>
{CHARA:r2B}
"Perhaps she hasn't healed yet?"@>
I doubt she'll ever recover again.@>
That's what I think, but I decide not to tell Mizuho.@>
"Where were you two heading to?"@>
"It seems Kanako wants to go somewhere.@ That's why I'm accompanying her."@>
Mizuho says throwing a straight look at me.#

{BLOCK:13}
"Fine.@ I'll follow her, so you go home now."@>
As soon as I say that, Mizuho opens wide her eyes.@>
{CHARA:r26}
"N-No!@ Please take me with you!@ I beg you!"@>
"No."@>
I decline firmly.@>

{BLOCK:14}
"For the umpteenth time, this is a very dangerous incident.@ If something serious happens, I won't be able to protect you!"@>
"I don't care!"@>
"How come?!@ It's your own safety!"@>
"But I can't leave Kanako alone!"@>
"M-Mizuho..."@>
I'm at a loss for words before her overwhelming demands.#

{BLOCK:15}
Her shoulders are quivering, and her eyes are slightly teary.@>
She's seriousness incarnate.@>
I knew she was a obstinate girl, but I had no idea she was the kind of girl that tries to impose her own will by force.@>
She even looks terrified at her own forcefulness.@>
Given Ohta is in the equation, she's so agitated she's unable to get a hold of herself.#

{BLOCK:16}
"Please!@ I beg you! PLEASE!@ PLEASE TAKE ME WITH YOU!"@>
*Drip*@ *Drip*@ Tears flow down from her eyes.@>
"......"@>
I make a brief pause, and then let out a small sigh.#

{BLOCK:17}
"Okay, you win."@>
{CHARA:r2A}
"Yuu...@ suke..."@>
{CHARA:r23}
Mizuho wipes the tears on the inner side of her glasses.@>
"In exchange, I want you to forget about me and escape at the slightest sign of danger."@>
"Yes, I promise."@>
{CHARA:r2A}
"Aside from that..."#

{BLOCK:18}
At that very moment, Mizuho's clear eyes open wide out of the blue.@>
{REFCHAR:r26}
"N-No!@ Kanako...!"@>
"Mizuho...?"@>
"Yuusuke!@ Watch o--!"@>
In unison with Mizuho's shout...\c
{BGMSTOP}

{BLOCK:19}
{QUAKE}
{FLASH}
*THUMP*!#

{BLOCK:20}
As soon as I feel a heavy impact in the back of my head, my consciousness fades away at an alarming speed...\c
{BG:000011}
\e

{BLOCK:21}
*THUD*!@>
I hear something falling to the ground.#

{BLOCK:22}
A-A rock?!@>
Yeah, it's indeed a rock...@ And a gigantic one of top of that...#

{BLOCK:23}
Hold up.@ Was I hit in the head with THAT enormous boulder?!@>
Shouldn't I be dead?@>
Who the hell did it?@>
Ohta?!@>
Ohta, huh...?@ I see.@ Yeah, of course...#

{BLOCK:24}
Accepting the truth in such a weird way, I let myself fall into a jet-black darkness.#
