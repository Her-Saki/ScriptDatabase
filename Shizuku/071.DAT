{BLOCK:0}
"Ah!"@>
As soon as I catch a glimpse of the inside I let out an unintentional, brief gasp of surprise, and shut my mouth immediately after.@>
"......"@>
Fortunately, it seems my voice didn't reach inside, and nobody noticed I'm here.@>
Unable to believe my own eyes, I point my gaze to the room once more.\c
{BGMNEXT:21}
{BGMFOUT}
{HSCENE:121010}
\e

{BLOCK:1}
The very first thing that catches my eye is the pair of nude girls in the middle of the darkness, whose pale skin stands out inside it.@>
Lying indecently stark-naked on the floor, they finger mutually their breasts and groins.@>
Their seductive moans...@ Their intense fingerplay...@>
Pearl-like sweatdrops flow down their limbs as they absorbedly, fervently masturbate each other.#

{BLOCK:2}
And sitting in a chair there's a man enjoying the show with a smile.@>
It's a bizarre scene indeed.@>
Unconcernedly showing their obscene performance to the man, both girls increase the speed of their fingers, immersing themselves in an even more heated fapping.@ Just like two animals going berserk, they make a moaning, sticky mess of each other as their minds fall into an abyss of sheer pleasure.@>
Slightly amused, the man looks down on them with a cold glare and an emtpy smile.#

{BLOCK:3}
I remember their faces.@>
If I recall correctly, these girls raping each other's genitals with their own hands are members of the student council.@>
I only glanced briefly at them when I came to visit Mizuho after classes ended, but I have no doubt it's them.@>
Judging by their appearance, I'd have never guessed they'd be able to moan like beasts in heat.#

{BLOCK:4}
All the while the man watches them with an icy stare...@ 
Judging by his position, I figure he's the mastermind behind this, but I know his face.@>
It was just a coincidence, but I met him by chance in front of this room when he was with the girls.@>
Tsukishima, the former council president.@>
Ruriko's older brother...\c
{BG:161010}
\e

{BLOCK:5}
I switch my gaze to Ruriko who is standing by my side.@>
Wearing her usual expressionless face, she's staring at a faraway point in space.@>
What are you going to do, Ruriko?@>
"Your brother...@ is in there."@>
I say, and Ruriko smiles sweetly.@>
Is really Tsukishima the ringleader behind this incident?@>
If that's true, what should I do?@>
We're talking about your brother, Ruriko...#

{BLOCK:6}
My uncle's hypothesis hit the bull's eye.@>
The late-night meetings were actually happening.@>
Ironically, they're performing this acts in the place where the "superior" students gather.
{HSCENE:121010}
\e

{BLOCK:7}
I return my gaze once again to Tsukishima inside the room.@>
He's glaring at the pair of girls with contempt as they writhe in agony, calmly resting his chin in his hand and his elbow on the armrest.@ Then, he moves his gaze to the inner wall.@>
"Uuuh...@ Aaah...!"@>
In the corner of the room he's looking at, I hear the panting voice of someone trying to subdue their emotions.@>
That voice is from...@>
Mizuho!!@>
I shout inwardly.\c
{HSCENE:131010}
\e

{BLOCK:8}
Mizuho's there with tears rounding her eyes.@ The chest of her uniform is opened and all she's wearing is cute underwear.@>
Both of her hands are fixed behind her back as if tied with something.@>
White hands toy with her chest and groin.@>
Someone is caressing indecently Mizuho's underdeveloped body from behind.@>
Her knees are shaking, and she can barely stand on her feet.#

{BLOCK:9}
"Ah...@ N-No..."@>
With teary eyes, Mizuho lets out a painful gasp.@>
The white hands keep defiling Mizuho's body with a regular, almost robotic rhythm.@>
The left hand that sneaks below her bra massages her small breasts.@>
The fingertips of the right hand that approach her underwear from the hem of her skirt fiddle with her most sensitive body part.#

{BLOCK:10}
The owner of the pale hands sexually assaulting Mizuho is the bandaged man.@>
No, to be precise...@ it's a girl.@>
The bits of face that stick out from her removed bandages are undoubtedly feminine, and painful scars are carved on her cheeks.@>
When I look closer, I notice it clearly.@>
That girl is...#

{BLOCK:11}
"S-Stop, Kanako..."@>
Mizuho cries painfully.@>
Yeah, no doubt about it.@>
It's Ohta.@>
Those scars on her face are product of her self-harming attack of the other day.#

{BLOCK:12}
She was supposedly hospitalized in a general hospital.@ What is she doing here?@>
Did she escape?@>
No, that's not unthinkable.@>
Her sexual drive was so pathologically high she might as well be considered a drug addict.@>
Now that she lost her mind, she acts by instinct, and instinct alone.@ In fact, she coming here could even be considered the most natural outcome.#

{BLOCK:13}
Ohta's eyes are just like three days ago.@>
Unfocused like a dark lake under a moon night.@>
The eyes of a broken person...@ Just like Ruriko's.@>
With a broad smile on her face, she keeps fondling Mizuho like a busted machine.\c
{BG:391010}
\e

{BLOCK:14}
"P-Please stop, Kanako..."@>
Despite Mizuho begs for mercy, Ohta doesn't react at all and never stops moving her hands.@>
{CHARA:r41}
"It's useless, Aihara."@>
Tsukishima, who was watching boredly, speaks for the first time.@>
"In her current state not only she can't hear you, she's not even aware of what she's doing."@>
Mizuho opens her eyes and furrows.#

{BLOCK:15}
"Now she's like a robot that doesn't show interest in anything but sex.@ Hmm, a robot, huh?@ Hahahahaha, that's a great analogy, if I do say so myself.@ Your friend is exactly like a heartless robot."@>
{CHARA:r25}
"W-What are you talking about?"@>
Mizuho's close to crying.@>
{CHARA:r41}
"I just wanted some toys, that's all."@>
Tsukishima says smiling like an innocent kid.#

{BLOCK:16}
"Slaved toys whose only purpose is to fulfill my sexual desires, that is."@>
Tsukishima slowly stands up from his chair and crushes under his shoe the abdomen of one of the girls masturbating the other one absent-mindedly on the floor.@>
{CHARA:r99}
"Ah, aah, aaaaah!"@>
The girl whose stomach was stomped urinates herself along with a moan of pleasure, and just like that, she reaches the climax.@>
The room fills with the stench of ammonia.\c
{CHARA:r41}
\e

{BLOCK:17}
"But, anybody would eventually get tired of using always the same toys, right?@ I already played to my heart's content with her vaginas, mouths and anuses, and grew tired of it.@ That's why I thought it's time to discard them."@>
Tsukishima tramples on the face of the girl with the sole of his shoe, who looks ecstatic as she drowns in the aftermath of her orgasm.@>
Despite he's stepping on her, she lets out a seductive pant.#

{BLOCK:18}
"As you can see, these girls can't live anymore without my dick.@ Every night they come to suck my semen like bees absorbing nectar from flowers."@>
As Tsukishima treads on the elated, exhausted girl, the other girl approaches him crawling.#

{BLOCK:19}
The girl unzips Tsukishima's trousers, and after finding out his penis she takes it out with lovely care, smiling like a baby.#
She holds out her pink tongue, akin to a living creature, and rolls it around his flaccid penis.@ Then, she opens wide her mouth and holds his member into it as if trying to swallow it.@ After that, she keeps sucking his sexual organ wholeheartedly, with those unfocused eyes like a dark like under a moon night...#

{BLOCK:20}
"I tried to dump your friend, Ohta, but she came to my house crying."@>
Tsukishima moves apart forcefully the girl that keeps fellating him and walks towards Mizuho.@>
{CHARA:r25}
"D-Did you do something bad to Kanako?!"@>
With her eyes full of tears, Mizuho stares at Tsukishima with a defiant, corageous glare, but completely unperturbed, he gives her back a pure, childish smile.#

{BLOCK:21}
"Something bad?@ I wasn't rough with her, but..."@
"But...@ what?"@
Mizuho's on the verge of tears.@>
{CHARA:r41}
"She was so annoying I broke her.@ Her mind, I mean.@ I destroyed her soul so that she doesn't feel pain, sadness, or jealousy anymore..."@>
"You... broke... her mind...?"@>
"Yes, that's right.@ I used a special kind of electromagnetic waves."@>
"Electromagnetic... waves...?"\c
{BG:161010}
\e

{BLOCK:22}
Electromagnetic waves.@>
As soon as I hear that term coming out of his mouth, Ruriko's voice echoes in a corner of my head.\c
{CHABG:r00310505}
\e

{BLOCK:23}
"You can receive electromagnetic waves, can't you, Nagase?"#

{BLOCK:24}
Electromagnetic waves.@>
I'd have never expected to hear Ruriko's catchphrase HERE of all places.@>
{BG:160505}
No, if I think about it, perhaps it's the most natural thing to happen.@>
Tsukishima and Ruriko are siblings, after all.@ It's not surprising that they share the same oddities.\c
{CHABG:r42391010}
\e

{BLOCK:25}
Tsukishima's smiling like a kid showing off proudly his toy collection.@>
"I love talking about electromagnetic waves.@ Well, I'm proud of them, after all."@>
Tsukishima grazes one of Mizuho's cheeks softly.@>
"Eeek!"@>
Mizuho's body freezes.@>
"Do you know about toxic electromagnetic waves, Aihara?"#

{BLOCK:26}
"I-I don't...@ care..."@>
Mizuho lets out a painful gasp.@ Ohta has never stopped stroking and stimulating her erogenous zones.@>
"These poisonous waves pour down from the sky and drive people crazy.@ As their name suggests, they're literally toxic electromagnetic waves that make humans act in bizarre ways.@ They're invisible to the eye, and penetrate our brains without us knowing.@ There's no way to block them."#

{BLOCK:27}
Tsukishima grabs Mizuho's breasts violently and rubs them intensely along with Ohta's left hand.@>
"Ah, aaah!"@ P-Please stop..."@>
Still smiling, Tsukishima keeps talking.@>
"By nature, human thoughts and feelings are basically an array of electric signals, aren't they?@ What the toxic electromagnetic waves do is distorting and polluting them.@ Don't you find them fascinating?@ They can twist the mind of a person from outside..."#

{BLOCK:28}
Tsukishima slips his right hand into Mizuho's skirt.@>
"Ah!@ N-No!"@>
Big tears drop from Mizuho's eyes as she blushes.@>
Mercilessly, Tsukishima's fingertips infiltrate Mizuho's underwear and come in contact with her sexual organ.#

{BLOCK:29}
"!"@>
Tsukishima's cold fingers tamper with her organ, which Ohta's fingers have already soaked and warmed up thoroughly, as if playing with it.@>
"Heee!@ Fooaaah!"@>
He stimulates skillfully her already sensitive zone with his icy fingertips, making Mizuho more and more aroused.@>
"But, what if someone could actually manipulate those toxic waves themselves?@ Don't you think it's an interesting thought experiment?@ That means said person would be able to control other people's mind from afar, as if using a remote control..."#

{BLOCK:30}
Wearing a malicious grin, Tsukishima applies force into his fingertips.@>
"I can do that!@ I was the one who crushed Ohta's spirit!@ Hahaha!@ I shattered it into pieces!"@>
"Heeeaaah!"@>
Mizuho bends backwards vehemently.@ Her knees shake as well as her whole body.@>
Eventually, her knees lose all strenght and she falls flat to the floor.#

{BLOCK:31}
"Oh?@ Did you come?@ Hahaha, despite appearances, you're a pretty lascivious girl, Aihara."@>
Staring at the ceiling, Mizuho cries her eyes away.@>
However, Ohta, who is behind her, doesn't give her a rest.@ She hangs over Mizuho who reached the climax just a moment ago, and begins to stroke her over-sensitive intimate zone as if rubbing salt into the wound.#

{BLOCK:32}
"That was enough... don't you think?@ Kana... ko..."@>
Shedding tears, Mizuho talks gently to Ohta as if dealing with a little kid.@>
"For the umpteenth time, I told you it's useless you try and talk with her, Aihara."@>
"H-He's lying, isn't he, Kanako?@ You know who I am, right?@ You're just pulling my leg, aren't you?"@>
It seems Mizuho's painful, sobbing voice is not reaching Ohta's ears.#

{BLOCK:33}
"Don't even bother.@ Once a person is broken, not even I can restore them back to normal."@>
Tsukishima's words pierce Mizuho's heart like a blade made of ice.@>
She cries incessantly like a downpour.@>
Stricken with grief and hopelessness, Mizuho hangs her head silently as her slender shoulders quiver.#

{BLOCK:34}
Ohta fingers Mizuho persistently.@>
She caresses her as precisely as an automated doll.@>
And then, finally, Mizuho says in a low voice:@>
{CHARA:r25}
"If what you said is true and you made Ohta like this, Tsukishima..."@>
She glares at Tsukishima with a hatred-filled death stare.@>
"I'LL NEVER FORGIVE YOU!"\c
{CHARA:r41}
