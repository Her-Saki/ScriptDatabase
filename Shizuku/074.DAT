I observe Ruriko sitting next to me.@>
She's as quiet as a doll, as expressionless as always.@>
Ruriko has no idea her brother is inside there.@ She doesn't know, and I don't want her to know.@>
Beyond this thin wall, her brother is throwing a party packed with insane levels of debauchery.@ She doesn't have to know that, for it'd only leave a deep scar in her heart.#

{BLOCK:1}
Toxic electromagnetic waves that allow you to control other people at will...@ Do they really exist?@ No, that doesn't matter now.@ It doesn't change the fact that a tragedy is occurring inside.@>
I strengthen my resolve.@>
I'll save both of them.@>
Even though I know I can't do anything with my power,@>
the only thing I must absolutely never do...@>
is running away.#

{BLOCK:2}
Up until now, all I did was escaping from everything.@>
I didn't want to get hurt, so I didn't try to make friends.@>
I hated challenges that involved winning or losing, so I didn't compete with anyone.@>
I was more afraid of paying the price to achieve something than making efforts towards it.@>
I'm now a mere breathing lump of flesh.@>
I have no reason to exist in this world.#

{BLOCK:3}
I was always running away, so I felt...@>
that the world didn't need a coward like me,@>
but now...@>
Now things are different.@>
At the very least, I must save Mizuho and Shinjo without running away.@>
I feel that, right now, that's the only reason I have left to live.\c

{BLOCK:4}
I pull Ruriko by the hand and embrace her tenderly.@>
"What's wrong, Naga?"@>
She mutters.@>
"Ruriko..."@>
"Are you sad?"@>
"No, that's not it.@ It's just we'll separate for today."@>
"......"@>
I hug Ruriko by her slim shoulders.#

{BLOCK:5}
"You go straight home, Ruriko.@ I have something to do now."@>
"......"@>
Ruriko doesn't answer anything.@>
The warmth of her body and her calm breath that moves her chest up and down ease my nervousness.@>
It feels... peaceful, like a small cluster of ice melting in a cup filled with water.@>
I'd rather just stay like this forever.@>
But...#

{BLOCK:6}
Delicately, I grab Ruriko's thin shoulders and slowly draw myself apart from her chest.@>
And then...@>
"See you tomorrow, Ruriko."@>
I say a brief goodbye to her.\c
