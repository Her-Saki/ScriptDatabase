{BLOCK:0}
{BGMPLAY:05}
Toxic electromagnetic waves that allow you to control other people at will...@ Do they really exist?@ No, that doesn't matter now.@ It doesn't change the fact that a tragedy is occurring inside.@>
I strengthen my resolve.@>
I'll save both of them.@>
Even though I know I can't do anything with my power,@>
the only thing I must absolutely never do...@>
is running away.#

{BLOCK:1}
Up until now, all I did was escaping from everything.@>
I didn't want to get hurt, so I didn't try to make friends.@>
I hated challenges that involved winning or losing, so I didn't compete with anyone.@>
I was more afraid of paying the price to achieve something than making efforts towards it.@>
I'm now a mere breathing lump of flesh.@>
I have no reason to exist in this world.#

{BLOCK:2}
I was always running away, so I felt...@>
that the world didn't need a coward like me,@>
but now...@>
Now things are different.@>
At the very least, I must save Mizuho and Shinjo without running away.@>
I feel that, right now, that's the only reason I have left to live.#

{BLOCK:3}
I'm gonna call my uncle.@>
If I give him the full picture, he can take care of the rest even if something serious happens to me now.@>
There's a public phone in the hallway that connects the school building with the second gym.@>
I'm gonna use that.#

{BLOCK:4}
"Let's go, Ruriko."@>
I pull Ruriko by the hand and start walking.@>
"Where are you going, Naga?"@>
Ruriko asks in a whisper.@>
"I'm going to make a call."@>
"A call?"@>
"Yeah, to my uncle."\c
{BGMNEXT:11}

{BLOCK:5}
Illuminated only by the moonlight, we move to the hallway of the second gym.@>
The green public phone is next to a juice vending machine placed there.@>
I pick up the receiver, take out a telephone card from my wallet, and insert it into the machine.@>
*Beeem*@ The line connects.#

{BLOCK:6}
Wait a minute.@>
I throw a glance at Ruriko.@>
She's as expressionless as always, and as quiet as a doll.@>
If I talk now, Ruriko might overhear our conversation.@>
Ruriko doesn't know her brother is inside that room.@ She doesn't know, and I don't want her to know either.#

{BLOCK:7}
{PCMLOAD:06}
Her own brother is throwing a party full of demented lasciviousness just a few meters away from us.@>
She doesn't have to know about that.@>
After all, finding out about that would only hurt her feelings.@>
"Sorry, Ruriko, but could you please leave me alone for a moment?@ I have something important to talk with my uncle."@>
Ruriko nods, and obeying my command, she gets away from me.@>
I call my uncle without delay.#

{BLOCK:8}
{PCMPLAY:0220}
*Riiing* *Riiing*

{PCMFOUT}
\p*Click!*#

{BLOCK:9}
Perhaps he was worried about me, because he picks up at the second ring.@>
"Hello, Nagase here."@>
"Ah, uncle?@ I'm Yuusuke."@>
"Oh, Yuusuke.@ How are you doing?"@>
Hearing his bright voice takes me back to reality.#

{BLOCK:10}
"Listen.@ I have no time to spare so I'll cut to the chase.@ Just as you surmised, the group in question is throwing an orgy this precise moment."@>
"What?!@ For real?!"@>
"Yes."@>
"Where?@ How many people?@ Did you see their faces?"@>
"The place is the student council.@ As for their number...@ They're four.@ The ringleader seems to be Tsukishima, the former student council president."@>
Upon mentioning Tsukishima's name, I make sure Ruriko's not near me.#

{BLOCK:11}
"Tsukishima?@ THAT Tsukishima?!"@>
"Yes."@>
"I can't believe it..."@>
My uncle is right in disbelieving it.@>
Tsukishima is a well-respected, honor student who is trusted by students and teachers alike.@>
"But it's the truth."@>
"Alright, you got it.@ Good job, Yuusuke.@ I'm going there now, so wait a bit longer.@ Where are you now?"#

{BLOCK:12}
"No, I'm afraid I can't wait for so long.@ Two friends of mine were caught and are suffering horrible things right now.@ I'm going to rescue them."@>
"Wait, don't do it.@ It's dangerous.@ I'm going there now, so wait for me!"@>
Part of Mizuho's involvement in this mess was a byproduct of my uncle's careless actions, but I intentionally avoid that topic.#

{BLOCK:13}
"No, I can't let them suffer any longer.@ That's my last reason to live."@>
"Yuusuke, what are you...?"@>
"Anyway, I'm going now.@ Try to come as soon as possible, okay?@ Remember, I'll be in the student council's room."@>
"H-Hey, hold up, Yuusuke!@ Don't hang up!"#

{BLOCK:14}
*Click!*#

{BLOCK:15}
I put down the receiver.@>
Alright.@>
Now, even if Tsukishima catches me, my uncle will do something about this.@>
A stitch in time saves nine, as they say.#

{BLOCK:16}
I give a sigh and turn back, but then...@>
A human-like shadow stands before me.@>
{BGMFOUT}
{BGMWAIT}
"R-Ruri--"@>
The backlight doesn't let me see well her face, but judging by her haircut, I think is Ruriko who overheard my call.@>
"D-Did you hear...?"#

{BLOCK:17}
{PCMLOAD:10}
No, it's not her.@>
It's not Ruriko!@>
"Y-You are...!"\c
{CHARA:c32}

{BLOCK:18}
{QUAKE}
{FLASH}
*THUD!*#

{BLOCK:19}
As soon as I feel a strong blow in the back of my head, my consciousness start fading out very quickly...\c
{BG:000011}

{BLOCK:20}
I fall to the ground.@>
*THMP!*@>
At the same time, I hear something heavy dropped onto the ground.@>
I look in that direction.#

{BLOCK:21}
A-A rock?!@>
It's a rock...@ And as big as a boulder...#

{BLOCK:22}
Was someone behind me?@>
Did she hit me with that heavy rock?@>
Will I die now...?@>
Right before losing my consciousness, I see the face of a girl standing before me.@>
It's, without a doubt, Ohta.#

{BLOCK:23}
Ohta, huh?@>
I see.@ So she already noticed me.@>
Goddamit.@>
I was careless...#

{BLOCK:24}
As I'm engulfed in jet-black darkness, I become worried about Ruriko.#
