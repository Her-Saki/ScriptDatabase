{BLOCK:0}
Little time I had to realize my body is free, because I'm once again transformed into a puppet through his electromagnetic waves.@>
Deprived of our freedom, we become Tsukishima's toys through and through; controlled by his waves, we five keep engaging in intercourse taking turns with each other.@>
The student council girls play with Mizuho and me while Ohta toys with Shinjo.@>
Amidst this sticky, lukewarm, humid atmosphere, this feast of lustful craziness keeps on and on with no end in sight.#

{BLOCK:1}
My consciousness becomes gradually hazy.@>
I can't...@ reason about anything anymore.@>
Why am I here?@>
Why am I doing this?@>
My memories become more and more vague with each passing second.@>
Everything that happened today feels like it was a dream.@>
I take a look around trying to recollect the past, but all I see inside my field of vision are the pale, naked girls.#

{BLOCK:2}
I hear a voice coming from somewhere.@>
{CHARA:c45}
"Huhuhu...@ Sex, sex...@ Yeah, keep fucking, bitches!@ Fiercer!@ Rougher!@ Rub your pussies and dicks, mix your love juices and cum and continue to fuck until your very flesh melts!@ At some point I'm gonna bring in all the students across the school too, and those hypocrite teachers as well!@ Yeah, just try and graduate.@ Once the ceremony starts and everyone gathers in the hall, I'll send them electromagnetic waves.@ I'm gonna fill the holes of every girl with cum.@ The principal, the vice principal, everybody will satisfy themselves shoving their cocks inside their dear students' cunts like cattle mating with each other!"#

{BLOCK:3}
It's Tsukishima's voice.@>
Crouching on the floor with his head hanging low, Tsukshima whispers excitedly a strange soliloquy.@>
"After I'm done with the school, I'll involve everybody in the city.@ I'm gonna make complete strangers fuck with each other for no reason.@ No matter if it's between parents and children, between siblings, between women, between men, between kids, between elders, or between babies; everyone without exception will intertwine their sexual organs and stain them with vaginal fluids and semen..."#

{BLOCK:4}
In my blurry field of vision, I gaze absent-mindedly at Tsukishima as he speaks.@>
His eyes are rotten to the core.@>
They remind me...@>
of Ruriko and Ohta's eyes.@>
Dull, darkened eyes akin to a somber lake illuminated by dim moonlight in the dead of the night.#

{BLOCK:5}
I see...@>
Those eyes tell me everything.@>
So that's what it is, huh?@>
This guy, too, opened...@>
the gate towards insanity.#

{BLOCK:6}
"Sex, sex, sex, I'm gonna make EVERYONE have sex.@ They'll shake their hips until they wear out their genitalia and bleed.@ They're gonna get smeared in blood, cum, and pussy juice...@ They'll drink those fluids when they're parched and bite each other's flesh when hungry, all while they fuck endlessly.@ Huhuhu, sex...@ Sex,@ sex,@ sex,@ sex,@ sex,@ sex sex sex sex sex SEX SEX SEX SEX SEX..."\c

{BLOCK:7}
At a certain moment, a little piece fell off a machine.@ Perhaps it was irrelevant or maybe it had some kind of importance, but regardless, it had a small effect on a cogwheel.@ That cogwheel affected another one, and that one disturbed another one, and so on and so forth, until eventually, that chain of accidents ended up altering the spin of a major gear.@>
Even if someone noticed that subtle irregularity at the beginning, it was too late.@ By then, the machine was already spinning in the wrong direction...#

{BLOCK:8}
No one can stop Tsukishima anymore.@>
He'll just keep walking his path smashing all the obstacles in the way.@>
A path of insanity and destruction...@>
where we all are dragged behind him.\c

{BLOCK:9}
I was always running away.@>
Every day of my life was filled with boredom and tedium.@>
I felt hopelessly alone and my existence lost all meaning.@>
That meaninglessness I felt towards living made me feel depressed and hurt, and it crushed my heart.@>
At some point, I stopped hearing my inner voice that was blaming me for being that way.#

{BLOCK:10}
The stupid real world lost all color, and by covering my ears, I cut off all sound around me.@>
Before I noticed, my daily life had become a stagnated, monochrome, silent film.@>
I was a small flame burning atop a slender candle, so feeble that it could be blown away from the world with the slightest breeze.@>
I was about to disappear.#

{BLOCK:11}
However, despite being like that, there was something that provided me with fervent, sticky, blood-pumping excitement as well as fiery, electrifying euphoria.@>
That was...@ fantasies.@>
Whenever I fantasized about the apocalypsis, even if only for a little while, I became strongly aware of my own existence.@>
I had found my place to be.#

{BLOCK:12}
Reality lost its color and sound at an alarming speed, while on the contrary, delusions became more vivid every passing day.@>
After repeating such deliriums for a long time, I eventually became unable to distinguish fantasy from reality.@>
That was around the time the door of insanity appeared in my sight.@>
Everything became clear to me.@>
If I could reach that door and open it, I could say goodbye to this lonely world.@>
Beyond that gate, an endless world of drug-like pleasure was waiting for me...#

{BLOCK:13}
That's why, in all honesty, I felt jealous of Ohta when she became possessed by insanity.@>
"I want to open the door soon too", I thought.@>
I wanted to travel to that sticky, pulpy, yet bright and energetic world as soon as possible.@>
I wished to depart for that eternal dream,@>
for that world of madness...@>
up until now.@>
Yeah, up until now.\c
{BG:000011}
\e

{BLOCK:14}
However...@ now things are different.@>
The values I used to hold fell apart quietly like a house of cards.@>
My wish to open the gate,@>
my wish to escape to another world...@>
and every other desire I had melted away like a light snowfall inside me.@>
That's because...\c

Because Ruriko isn't there.#

{BLOCK:16}
I want to live in the same world as Ruriko.@>
I want to behold the same insanity as her.@>
I want to feel her more in my skin.@>
I yearn for her...@>
I love everything about her.#

{BLOCK:17}
Her demented, melancholic eyes...@>
Her silky, thin hair...@>
Her tender bosom...@>
Her brittle, slender shoulders...@>
Her pale skin akin to a flame about to die out in the palm of my hand...@>
I find all of that lovely.#

{BLOCK:18}
I have to open my heart...@>
and listen closely to what happens around me.@>
I refuse to lose the sound and color of my world again.@>
I refuse to miss the color of Ruriko's hair and skin, and the sound of her voice and breath.#

{BLOCK:19}
Ruriko.@>
Ruriko.@ Ruriko.@ Ruriko.@ Ruriko.@ Ruriko.@ Ruriko.@ Ruriko.@ Ruriko.@ Ruriko.@ Ruriko.@ Ruriko.@ Ruriko.@ Ruriko.@ Ruriko.@ Ruriko.@ Ruriko.@ Ruriko.@ Ruriko.@ Ruriko.@ Ruriko.@ Ruriko.@ Ruriko.@ Ruriko.@ Ruriko.@ Ruriko.@ Ruriko.@ Ruriko.@ Ruriko.@ RURIKO!#

{BLOCK:20}
I want to meet Ruriko.@>
I want to meet Ruriko.@>
I want to meet Ruriko.@>
I want to meet Ruriko.@>
I want to meet Ruriko.@>
I want to meet Ruriko.@>

before I lose my soul.#

{BLOCK:22}
{FLASH}
{BGMSTOP}
*Crack!*#

{BLOCK:23}
At that moment, I hear an air-splitting sound.@>
A high-pitched noise barely audible to the human ear...@>
which wakes me up from my mild hallucinatory state.#

{BLOCK:24}
{FLASH}
{BG:141100}
The pure white mist clears away, and the film of the real world fades in.@>
Before my eyes, one of the girls turned into a puppet is licking my penis, her delicate body resting on all fours.#

{BLOCK:25}
"Naga..."@>
I think I heard Ruriko's voice just now.#

{BLOCK:26}
Before I realize it, the entrance door is open.@>
The tepid air of the room packed with the stench of pheromones leaks outside little by little.@ In turn, a cold gush of wind that kills my sleepiness comes in from the hallway.@>
Since when was it opened?@>
A person is standing there...@>
as the wind flutters her hair,@>
"Ruri...@ ko..."@>
and I call her name.\c
