{BLOCKLEN:60}

{BLOCK:0}
Even so, I keep rocking my hips in a trance.@>
I glide back and forth inside Ruriko countless times.@>
She lets out cute moans, and her breath tickles my neck.@>
I feel like I'm gonna cum at any time.#

{BLOCK:1}
{FLASH}
{FLASH}
*Bzzzt*@ *Bzzzt*@ At that moment, I feel particles of electricity running through my head, similarly to when those toxic electromagnetic waves washed over me.@>
"!"@>
This abrupt particle rush gains more and more momentum, until eventually, my field of vision becomes pure white.#

{BLOCK:2}
It's a torrent of light.@>
Before me, Ruriko is absorbed gradually by the light...@>
until I don't see anything anymore.\c
{BGMFOUT}
{BGMWAIT}
\e

{BLOCK:3}
"Feel...@ my electromagnetic waves...@ More...@ Much more..."@>
I think I'm hearing Ruriko's voice inside this dazzling light.@>
I cross the vortex of light...@>
and suddenly, the world before me turns pitch-black.#

{BLOCK:4}
What is...@ this...?\c
{BGMPLAY:10}
\e

{BLOCK:5}
{PCMLOAD:17}
Someone is crying amidst the darkness.@>
*Sob*@ *Sob*@>
I hear a girl weeping.@>
This is...@ that one dream.@>
Ruriko's dream that I saw in the rooftop.#

{BLOCK:6}
*Drip*@>
Teardrops fall quietly to the puddle and form gentle ripples of light.@>
Illuminated by those shiny ripples, the figure of Ruriko cowering comes into view.\c
{PCMWAIT}
{PCMFOUT}
{VISUAL:259912}
\e

{BLOCK:7}
A uniform with ragged sleeves,@ disheveled hair,@ tears...@>
Ruriko is...@ crying.#

{BLOCK:8}
"Why are you crying?"@>
"Why are you so sad?"@>
I shout just like I did last time.@>
However, as usual, my voice doesn't reach Ruriko.#

{BLOCK:9}
"I'm sorry, Ruriko."@>
I hear a voice from beyond the darkness; a gentle male voice which strikes a chord of remembrance in me.@>
"I'm sorry, Ruriko."@>
He repeats.@>
However, crouching on the floor, Ruriko just keeps crying.#

{BLOCK:10}
"Ruriko...@ I love you so much, and yet...@ Why...?"@>
The tears flowing down Ruriko's cheeks create bright ripples of light on the puddle.@>
"Is it really wrong?@ Falling in love in someone and pursuing that love until the end...@ Why should that be a taboo?"@>
It's a pure, innocent, unadulterated voice.@>
That is...@ Tsukishima's voice.#

{BLOCK:11}
Ruriko's teardrops keep drawing the light ripples incessantly.@>
"I love you, Ruriko.@ I love you, Ruriko."@>
Her shoulders tremble as she sobs.@>
"I love you, Ruriko.@ I love you, Ruriko.@ I love you, Ruriko.@ I love you, Ruriko..."@>
Just like before, Tsukishima repeats the same words like a spell.#

{BLOCK:12}
{FLASH}
{FLASH}
*BEEEM*@ *BEEEM*@ Electric current runs through my head.@>
In that instant, for some reason, I feel like I understand everything.@ I start to tie up all the loose ends that were unclear up until now.@>
I feel like Ruriko is trying to tell me the full story directly.#

{BLOCK:13}
I see.@>
So that was it, huh?@>
This...@ This film...@>
is a collection of memories.@>
Ruriko's memories, to be precise.#

{BLOCK:14}
This is the memory of the instant she opened the door of insanity.@>
And the trigger that made her open the door was none other than Tsukishima, her biological older brother.#

{BLOCK:15}
Ruriko's memories seep slowly into my heart.@>
Painful, heart-rending fragments of her past.\c

{BLOCK:16}
"I Love YOu,@ RuRIkO.@ I loVe YoU,@ RUriKo.@ I LOvE YOu RurIko.@ I LOVE you RuRikO I LoVe you rurIKO I LoVe yOu RurIKO I loVE You rURikO I lovE yOU RurikO I Love YoU rurIko I LOvE yOu RUriKo I lOve YoU rurIKO I LOVE YoU ruRIKo..."\c
{VISUAL:090000}
\e

{BLOCK:17}
In an unexpected turn of events, Ruriko's parents died in a car accident when she was four years old.@>
Since Ruriko was still a child, she took part in the funeral without understanding well what happened to her parents, and had to wear a pitch-black, western-style attire.#

{BLOCK:18}
Little Ruriko found it weird that people around here cried so sadly, so she asked her older brother, who was enduring the tears the best he could before her:@>
"Why's everyone crying?"@>
Ruriko looked upwards, and her brother wiped his tears, smiled, and embraced her gently.@>
"We're in this together, Ruriko.@ I'm by your side, so don't cry."@>
He said embracing Ruriko tight, so much that it hurt her.#

{BLOCK:19}
"Where's daddy?@ And mommy?@ Ruriko wanna see daddy and mommy."@>
However, he didn't answer anything.@>
"Hey, brother, where's daddy?@ And mommy?"@>
His back trembled slightly.@>
While she didn't understand why, Ruriko noticed that he was crying, and stopped asking about her parents.@>
She didn't want to make her dear brother sad.#

{BLOCK:20}
Ruriko was adopted along with her brother, her only family member left, by her uncle, who worked as a head doctor at a general hospital.@>
However, that place would never become a resting place for the young siblings.@>
After adopting small kids like them, the marriage of their uncle took a turn for the worse, and since they didn't have children on their own, the couple filed for divorce in no time.#

{BLOCK:21}
For the time being, they stayed under the care of their uncle, but since then, he started to treat them more and more harshly.@>
By the time Ruriko was promoted to middle school, her uncle physically abused her brother every day.@>
Both of them never opened their heart to their uncle, and they didn't trust anyone but themselves.\c
{BG:000011}
\e

{BLOCK:22}
As those days continued on, Ruriko became gradually introverted, and eventually, she stopped expressing herself to anyone but Tsukishima.@>
She didn't make friends at school, and ultimately turned into a sort of autistic girl, someone who always escaped to the realm of books.#

{BLOCK:23}
Taking advantage of his carefree single life, their uncle got into affairs with several women.@>
Aided by his juicy position as chairman of the hospital, he could ask just about anyone for sex, and every night he brought home unknown women and led an outrageous sexual life.@>
Every night, the kids had to hear the moans of those unfamiliar women.@>
They covered their ears and embraced each other as they trembled.#

{BLOCK:24}
Who would have guessed that, at some point, that trauma would become Tsukishima's complex and that it would lead him to perpetrate such atrocities?#

{BLOCK:25}
The siblings cuddled close together every night, quivering, without ever talking to anybody about what they were going through.@>
Meanwhile, those sensual gasps echoed night in, night out.@>
At some point in the rough life he was leading, Tsukishima's sibling love for her little sister gradually warped into romantic love of a man for a woman.#

{BLOCK:26}
He probably knew well even back then that it was a forbidden love.@>
However, his intense feelings became such an obsession that he ended up violating that taboo.#

{BLOCK:27}
What happened that day wasn't but a mere page in their normal, never-changing everyday.#

{BLOCK:28}
A certain day, after coming back from school as usual, Ruriko returned to her room in order to change her uniform.@>
It seemed like her brother had come back too, but he didn't answer when she called him, so she thought he was sleeping in his room.@>
She walked along the hallway, climbed up the stairs, and was about to open the door of her room...@ when she found her brother there.\c
{VISUAL:101100}
\e

{BLOCK:29}
As soon as she entered, Ruriko found her room ravaged.@>
All the drawers of her desk were turned upside down, and her wardrobe was all messed up inside.@>
Her underwear was scattered across the room, and her brother was standing up buried under them.#

{BLOCK:30}
She knew at first sight that her brother had lost his mind.@>
His eyes muddy like a deep swamp...@>
His mouth warped into a wicked smile...@>
His exposed penis.#

{BLOCK:31}
After that, Tsukishima stole Ruriko's body by force as she resisted.@>
That's what happened in that hot summer day.#

{BLOCK:32}
Having her body stolen by her brother left a deep scar inside Ruriko's heart, and she sealed off her soul in the darkness.@>
And then, eventually, she opened the door of insanity hidden in the depths of that darkness.\c
{BGMFOUT}
{BG:000011}
\e

{BLOCK:33}
"I LOVE YOU,@ RURIKO.@ I LOVE YOU,@ RURIKO.@ I LOVE YOU, RURIKO.@ I LOVE YOU RURIKO I LOVE YOU RURIKO I LOVE YOU RURIKO I LOVE YOU RURIKO I LOVE YOU RURIKO I LOVE YOU RURIKO I LOVE YOU RURIKO I LOVE YOU RURIKO I LOVE YOU RURIKO..."#

{BLOCK:34}
Tsukishima's voice echoes.#

{BLOCK:35}
"It's your fault.@ Because your heart was weak, Ruriko...@ Ruriko...!!"\c
{BGMPLAY:01}
\e

{BLOCK:36}
I scream.@>
In that very instant, something inside me erupts like fiery flames.#

{BLOCK:37}
A strange film is projected visually inside my head.@>
Hot elements...@>
Gooey elements...@>
Glistening elements...@>
Black, sticky elements...@>
All of those get mixed round and round and compressed until forming a single lump of energy.@>
{FLASH}
That mass shoots itself off with a BANG and gets ejected from my body vigorously.#

{BLOCK:38}
{FLASH}
*BZZZT* *BZZZT* *BZZZT* *BZZZT*@ Inside my head, particles of electric current swirl intensely.@>
{FLASH}
{FLASH}
As I draw those electric particles in my head, I move them at will from left to right.@>
I comprehend right away...@>
that I'm manipulating electromagnetic waves now.@>
This is what using them feels like.#

{BLOCK:39}
"You're just like me, Naga."@>
I think I'm hearing Ruriko's voice now.#

{BLOCK:40}
Yeah, it's just like you said.@ We're indeed similar.@>
After all, I can use electromagnetic waves too.\c
{BGMFOUT}
\e

{BLOCK:41}
*Shiiing!*@ At that moment, a radiant flash of light sparkles.#

{BLOCK:42}
My field of vision slowly goes back to normal.@>
The light gradually fades out and, before me, Ruriko's naked body comes into view.#
{BGMPLAY:08}
\e

{BLOCK:43}
We're in the middle of intercourse, both physical...@ and spiritual.@>
Our bodies are tied by our sexual organs, and our souls connected through the electromagnetic waves we release.@>
We send images inside our minds to communicate visually in a more vivid way, and to feel each other more deeply.#

{BLOCK:44}
Ruriko's legs cling to my lower half.@>
I embrace her body tight.@>
"Aaah...!@ N-Naga...@ Naga!"@>
Ruriko's body springs up.@>
Her whole body stiffens, her vaginal walls compress, and her vagina is overflowing with love juices.#

{BLOCK:45}
A lightning wave of pleasure races through my lower half, and at the same time, I reach the climax.@>
*Splash* *Splash*@ I ejaculate countless time inside her vagina.@>
Ruriko's intimate zone twitches and presses against my penis at a regular pace.@>
It seems Ruriko had an orgasm too.@>
*Fwip*@ She places her adorable face sideways and, just like that, she keeps breathing roughly.#

{BLOCK:46}
Ruriko clings to my hips with both legs and doesn't want to let go of me.@>
Without trying to set her apart by force, I stay inside her vagina where semen and love juices mix up.@>
And then we kiss again and again.#

{BLOCK:47}
I'm sure now that I'm able to control electromagnetic waves.@>
Ruriko gave me the chance to test them out.@>
By joining our bodies together, I learned to feel the waves more directly through her body.#

{BLOCK:48}
I understand everything now.@>
Ruriko wanted me to master the waves from the very start.@>
That's why she chose this method deliberately.@>
She went as far as showing me her painful past...\c
{HSCENE:321010}
\e

{BLOCK:49}
"Ruriko..."@>
I call her name quietly, and she opens her eyes faintly to look at me.@>
"You said I was crying a river, but you were the one actually crying, weren't you, Ruriko?@ Now that I can use electromagnetic waves I finally understand it.@ You were crying all this time asking for help."@>
I stroke Ruriko's smooth hair.#

{BLOCK:50}
"You knew from long ago that your brother used his waves to convert the student council girls into toys, but you couldn't stop him.@ After all..."@>
Ruriko stares at me intently.@>
"You can control electromagnetic waves just like him, but his are way more powerful than yours.@ That's why, despite you knew what was going on, you couldn't save the girls."@>
Ruriko nods.#

{BLOCK:51}
"And then you went every day to the rooftop to look for someone with the potential to use electromagnetic waves.@ You'd find a suitable candidate, teach them to use the waves, and then try to stop Tsukishima..."@>
I caress Ruriko's cheek softly.@>
Our sexual organs are still joined.@>
"That was me, right?"@>
Ruriko nods slowly.#

{BLOCK:52}
"Your heart is packed full with Tsukishima.@ You pity him, and feel sad about him...@ That's why you were always crying.@ "Save me, save me", you said.@ All this time you were searching for someone to rescue you."@>
Ruriko has a sad look on her face.@>
"Does that mean that your love confession and what we did just now was only because you wanted me to learn to use electromagnetic waves?@ Would you have done this with anyone else?"@>
I really hate myself for asking her this.#

{BLOCK:53}
Ruriko gazes fixedly at me with a puzzled look.@>
However, she eventually opens her mouth, little by little.@>
"I... love you, Naga.@ We're... alike, after all."@>
"Because we can both use electromagnetic waves?"@>
"No, not that.@ We're similar in almost every aspect.@ We were both crying inside, we wanted to disappear from the world, and we wanted someone to save us...@ We're birds of a feather."#

{BLOCK:54}
"......"@>
"That's why I wanted to save you.@ Because I'm just like you.@ I understand how much you're suffering.@ That's why I thought you'd save me too."@>
I become embarrassed of myself.@>
I realize now how pathetic my jealousy was.#

{BLOCK:55}
"I thought that you were someone I could talk to, that you'd understand me.@ And then, just as I expected, you believed me.@ You listened seriously to my story, without making fun of electromagnetic waves.@ That made me happy.@ I thought: "I wasn't wrong after all",@ so I..."#

{BLOCK:56}
I don't let Ruriko talk further.@>
I seal her soft lips with a long, long kiss.#

{BLOCK:57}
And after I'm done, I slowly draw my lips away from hers.#

{BLOCK:58}
"Let's go save everyone before this incident escalates further.@ We gotta stop Tsukishima.@ I can do that with the power I have now...@ can't I?"#

{BLOCK:59}
Ruriko answers nodding.\c
