{BLOCKLEN:49}

{BLOCK:0}
In that instant, for some reason, everything becomes clear to me.@
I start to tie up all the loose ends that were unclear up until now.@>
I feel like Ruriko is trying to tell me the full story directly.#

{BLOCK:1}
I see.@>
So that was it, huh?@>
This...@ This film...@>
is a collection of memories.@>
Ruriko's memories, to be precise.#

{BLOCK:2}
This is the memory of the instant she opened the door of insanity.@>
And the trigger that made her open it was none other than Tsukishima, her biological older brother.#

{BLOCK:3}
Ruriko's memories seep slowly into my heart.@>
Painful, heart-rending fragments of her past.\c
{BG:000011}

{BLOCK:4}
"I Love YOu,@ RuRIkO.@ I loVe YoU,@ RUriKo.@ I LOvE YOu RurIko.@ I LOVE you RuRikO I LoVe you rurIKO I LoVe yOu RurIKO I loVE You rURikO I lovE yOU RurikO I Love YoU rurIko I LOvE yOu RUriKo I lOve YoU rurIKO I LOVE YoU ruRIKo..."\c
{VISUAL:091100}
\e

{BLOCK:5}
In an unexpected turn of events, Ruriko's parents died in a car accident when she was four years old.@>
Since Ruriko was still a child, she took part in the funeral without understanding well what happened to her parents, and had to wear a pitch-black, western-style attire.#

{BLOCK:6}
Little Ruriko found it weird that people around here cried so sadly, so she asked her older brother, who was enduring the tears the best he could before her:@>
"Why's everyone crying?"@>
Ruriko looked upwards, and her brother wiped his tears, smiled, and embraced her gently.@>
"We're in this together, Ruriko.@ I'm by your side, so don't cry."@>
He said embracing Ruriko tight, so much that it hurt her.#

{BLOCK:7}
"Where's daddy?@ And mommy?@ Ruriko wanna see daddy and mommy."@>
However, he didn't answer anything.@>
"Hey, brother, where's daddy?@ And mommy?"@>
His back trembled slightly.@>
While she didn't understand why, Ruriko noticed that he was crying, and stopped asking about her parents.@>
She didn't want to make her dear brother sad.#

{BLOCK:8}
Ruriko was adopted along with her brother, her only family member left, by her uncle, who worked as a head doctor at a general hospital.@>
However, that place would never become a resting place for the young siblings.@>
After adopting small kids like them, the marriage of their uncle took a turn for the worse, and since they didn't have children on their own, the couple filed for divorce in no time.#

{BLOCK:9}
For the time being, they stayed under the care of their uncle, but since then, he started to treat them more and more harshly.@>
By the time Ruriko was promoted to middle school, her uncle physically abused her brother every day.@>
Both of them never opened their heart to their uncle, and they didn't trust anyone but themselves.\c
{BG:000011}
\e

{BLOCK:10}
As those days continued on, Ruriko became gradually introverted, and eventually, she stopped expressing herself to anyone but Tsukishima.@>
She didn't make friends at school, and ultimately turned into a sort of autistic girl, someone who always escaped to the realm of books.#

{BLOCK:11}
Taking advantage of his carefree single life, their uncle got into affairs with several women.@>
Aided by his juicy position as chairman of the hospital, he could ask just about anyone for sex, and every night he brought home unknown women and led an outrageous sexual life.@>
Every night, the kids had to hear the moans of those unfamiliar women.@>
They covered their ears and embraced each other as they trembled.#

{BLOCK:12}
Who would have guessed that, at some point, that trauma would become Tsukishima's complex and that it would lead him to perpetrate such atrocities?#

{BLOCK:13}
The siblings cuddled close together every night, quivering, without ever talking to anybody about what they were going through.@>
Meanwhile, those sensual gasps echoed night in, night out.@>
At some point in the rough life he was leading, Tsukishima's sibling love for her little sister gradually warped into romantic love of a man for a woman.#

{BLOCK:14}
He probably knew well even back then that it was a forbidden love.@>
However, his intense feelings became such an obsession that he ended up violating that taboo.#

{BLOCK:15}
What happened that day wasn't but a mere page in their normal, never-changing everyday.#

{BLOCK:16}
A certain day, after coming back from school as usual, Ruriko returned to her room in order to change her uniform.@>
It seemed like her brother had come back too, but he didn't answer when she called him, so she thought he was sleeping in his room.@>
She walked along the hallway, climbed up the stairs, and was about to open the door of her room...@ when she found her brother there.\c
{VISUAL:101100}
\e

{BLOCK:17}
As soon as she entered, Ruriko found her room ravaged.@>
All the drawers of her desk were turned upside down, and her wardrobe was all messed up inside.@>
Her underwear was scattered across the room, and her brother was standing up buried under them.#

{BLOCK:18}
She knew at first sight that her brother had lost his mind.@>
His eyes muddy like a deep swamp...@>
His mouth warped into a wicked smile...@>
His exposed penis.#

{BLOCK:19}
After that, Tsukishima stole Ruriko's body by force as she resisted.@>
That's what happened in that hot summer day.#

{BLOCK:20}
Having her body stolen by her brother left a deep scar inside Ruriko's heart, and she sealed off her soul in the darkness.@>
And then, eventually, she opened the door of insanity hidden in the depths of that darkness.\c
{BGMFOUT}
{BG:000011}

{BLOCK:21}
"I LOVE YOU,@ RURIKO.@ I LOVE YOU,@ RURIKO.@ I LOVE YOU, RURIKO.@ I LOVE YOU RURIKO I LOVE YOU RURIKO I LOVE YOU RURIKO I LOVE YOU RURIKO I LOVE YOU RURIKO I LOVE YOU RURIKO I LOVE YOU RURIKO I LOVE YOU RURIKO I LOVE YOU RURIKO..."#

{BLOCK:22}
Tsukishima's voice echoes.#

{BLOCK:23}
Inside me, a gigantic SOMETHING makes my heartbeats resound.\c
{BGMPLAY:01}
\e

{BLOCK:24}
A strange film is projected visually inside my head.@>
Hot elements...@>
Gooey elements...@>
Glistening elements...@>
Black, sticky elements...@>
Spinning in circles, all of them get mixed and compressed until forming a single lump of energy.@>
{FLASH}
That mass shoots itself off with a BANG and gets ejected from my body vigorously.#

{BLOCK:25}
*BZZZT* *BZZZT* *BZZZT* *BZZZT*@ Inside my head, particles of electric current swirl intensely.@>
{FLASH}
{FLASH}
As I draw those electric particles in my head, I move them at will from left to right.@>
I comprehend right away...@>
that I'm manipulating electromagnetic waves now.@>
This is what using them feels like.#

{BLOCK:26}
"You're just like me, Naga."@>
I recall Ruriko's words.#

{BLOCK:27}
Yeah, Ruriko, it's just as you say.@>
We're indeed similar...@>
because we can both use electromagnetic waves.\c
{BGMFOUT}
{BGMWAIT}
\e

{BLOCK:28}
*Shiiing!*@ In that instant, a radiant flash of light sparkles.#

{BLOCK:29}
My field of vision slowly goes back to normal.@>
The light gradually fades out and, before me, Ruriko's naked body comes into view.#

{BLOCK:30}
{BGMPLAY:13}
I keep raping Ruriko from behind, both with my body...@ and my mind.@>
My penis pierces her sexual organ and my soul transforms into toxic waves that dial up her sensivity to absurd levels.@>
It's an unconscious process.@>
I'm using my recently awakened powers unintentionally.@>
My desire of raping her rides on electromagnetic waves and manipulates her brain.#

{BLOCK:31}
I'm sure now I've become able to use electromagnetic waves.@>
When I focus my consciousness, I realize I'm generating a whirpool of electric current around me.@>
Perhaps the reason why I've learned to use the waves out of the blue is because I had sex with Ruriko.@>
By having intercourse with her, who could control the waves from the start, I was able to feel more directly their existence.#

{BLOCK:32}
I lean over Ruriko's body and rub violently her breasts.@>
I increased her sensivity via my toxic waves, so at this point even that massage sends pleasure waves up her spine.@>
"Aaah!@ N-Naga...@ Naga!"@>
Ruriko's body bends upwards.@>
Her whole body stiffens, her vaginal walls contract, and her intimate zone overflows with love juices.#

{BLOCK:33}
A lightning rush of pleasure races through my lower half, and at the same time, I reach the climax.@>
*Ba-dump*@ *Ba-dump*@ I ejaculate countless times inside her vagina.@>
*Twitch!*@ *Twitch!*@ Ruriko's vagina strangulates my penis at regular intervals.@>
It seems she had an orgasm too.@>
*Haa!*@ *Haa!*@ On all fours, she collapses exhaustedly and breathes roughly for a good while.\c
{HSCENE:351010}
\e

{BLOCK:34}
I slide out my penis from inside her vagina where semen and love juices mix up.@>
*Sop*@ *Sop*@ Semen overflows from her insides.@>
Blood didn't come out by breaking her hymen,@>
which proves she wasn't a virgin.#

{BLOCK:35}
Her first partner was Tsukishima.@>
Her chastity was stolen by her biological brother...@>
through half-rape sex.@>
Being raped by her brother, the only person she trusted, left a deep scar in her heart, and eventually...#

{BLOCK:36}
Ruriko lies down exhausted on the dusty mat.@>
My sticky semen overflows from the middle of her closed legs.@>
From time to time, while sobbing convulsively, her body stiffens.#

{BLOCK:37}
Even though I was under the influence of electromagnetic waves, I got carried away by my dishonorable lust and ended up raping Ruriko,@>
just like Tsukishima did that day...#

{BLOCK:38}
Sinister elements similar to simmering tar well up inside my heart.@>
Guilt, revulsion, jealousy, hatred...@ Pulpy energy mix of all those feelings dyes my heart pitch-black.#

{BLOCK:39}
That energy is boiling up ever so quietly.@>
It's increasing by the second, and eventually, eventually, eventually, eventually...#

{BLOCK:40}
"Uuuh...@ Na...@ ga..."@>
Teardrops flow down Ruriko's cheeks.#

{BLOCK:41}
"WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!"\c
{BGMNEXT:21}
{BGMFOUT}
{BG:000011}
\e

{BLOCK:42}
I grab my head with both hands and, unconsciously, dash out from that place.#

{BLOCK:43}
"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!"#

{BLOCK:44}
What the hell did I do?@>
Why is Ruriko collapsing on the ground, wearing nothing but her birthday suit?@>
I don't know.@>
I don't understand what happened.@>
I have no idea...@ how I did end up here!#

{BLOCK:45}
I jump out of the second gym and leave for the courtyard.@>
Illuminated by the light of the full moon, my shadow is projected sharply on the floor.\c
{BGMFOUT}
{BG:111102}
\e

{BLOCK:46}
I don't get it.@ I don't get, I don't get it.@ Don't get it, don't get it, don't get it,@ don't get it don't get it don't get it don't get it don't get it don't get it @don't get it don't get it don't get it don't get it don't get it don't get it don't get it don't get it don't get it don't get it don't get it don't get it...#

{BLOCK:47}
All I'm absolutely certain of...@>
is that...#

{BLOCK:48}
it's all his fault.#
