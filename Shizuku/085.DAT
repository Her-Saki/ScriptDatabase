{BLOCK:0}
10 minutes later, Ruriko and I leave the second gym behind and head once again to the student council.@>
In order to free Mizuho, Shinjo, Ohta and her friends from that realm of insanity, and to settle things with Tsukishima, I have acquired the power of electromagnetic waves.#

{BLOCK:1}
Halfway through our way to the student council I felt tempted to call up my uncle and tell him what happened, but I decided not to.@>
I don't want to involve any more people in this case.@>
If I lose against Tsukishima and become unable to put an end to his violence...@>
If that happens, I'll...#

{BLOCK:2}
Huhu, that's hilarious.@>
If that ever occurs, I won't have to worry about this matter anymore.@>
After all, I would disappear from this world as a human being.\c
{VISUAL:210303}
{BGMPLAY:12}
\e

{BLOCK:3}
Once we reach the front of the student council, I embrace Ruriko tight once last time.@>
Her brittle shoulders...@ Her beautiful, silky hair...@ The soft bulges of her chest...@>
All of that is deeply burned into my memory.@>
Even if...@ Even if I lose myself, I swear on my life I'll never forget Ruriko.@>
"Naga..."@>
Upon hearing her anxious voice, I answer her stroking gently her hair.\c
{BGMFOUT}
{BGMWAIT}
{BG:181010}
\e

{BLOCK:4}
The student council room is completely silent.@>
There's no sign of people inside.@>
Perhaps they moved to another place.@>
They might have laid a trap, too.@>
I take a deep breath as I ponder about that possibility.@>
To be honest, I'm terrified.@>
I want to run away.@>
But...#

{BLOCK:5}
I won't escape.@ Not anymore.@>
I won't turn my back to anything ever again.@>
My reason to live is right here.@>
I want to save Ruriko from her pain and sadness,@>
and that's what I'm gonna do.@>
"Okay, time to go."@>
I say drawing myself apart from Ruriko.#

{BLOCK:6}
Alright.@>
I inhale deeply and put my hand on the door knob.@>
I turn it quietly, being careful not to make a sound.@>
The knob rotates...@>
but I find out that the door is unlocked.@>
I exhale slowly, and then...\c
{BG:191010}
\e

{BLOCK:7}
*Click*@>
I open the door of the student council room.\c
{BGMPLAY:09}
{BG:141010}
\e

{BLOCK:8}
As always, the room is dim inside.@>
At first I thought nobody was here, but that was merely a groundless supposition.@>
Sweat and sexual fluids dripping...@>
Faint traces of amonnia stench...@>
And several pale, naked girls lying flabbily on the ground.@>
Exhausted, they rest on the floor in exactly the same position than when their act was interrupted.@>
It's almost as if time freezed when I jumped out of the room.#

{BLOCK:9}
As for Tsukishima...@>
He's sitting on a folding chair, bracing his knees and quivering.\c
{CHARA:c49}
\e

{BLOCK:10}
"I'm sorry@ Ruriko@ I didn't mean to do that@ forgive me Ruriko@ I love you@ I don't want anyone but you@ we were always alone, weren't we?@ You're the only one in my life@ Ruriko@ Ruriko@ Ruriko@ please don't abandon me@ don't go away from me@ let's keep going only the two of us forever and ever@ against wind and tide@ I swear I'll protect you Ruriko..."#

{BLOCK:11}
In a voice devoid of all inflection, Tsukishima keeps mumbling sentences without any punctuation marks as if it were a sutra.@>
His eyes look muddy, corrupt, and his pupils darkened and dull.@>
He stares intently at a fixed point in the floor as he repeats himself endlessly.\c
{CHARA:c99}
\e

{BLOCK:12}
"Yuu... suke..."@>
I hear a faint voice calling my name.@>
It's Mizuho.@>
With a worn-out body, she lifts her head and looks in my direction.@>
"Nagase..."@>
Just like Mizuho, Shinjo points her face at me after hearing her voice.@>
As if they had spent until the very last drop of their energy, they can't even get up by themselves.#

{BLOCK:13}
They were trapped inside this abnormal domain and forced to perform indecent, disgraceful acts.@>
Tsukishima's toxic electromagnetic waves increased several times the sensivity of their bodies and pushed them way past their limit.@>
All of them are, quite literally, dead tired.@>
"I came to rescue you all."@>
Upon hearing my words, they barely manage to crack a stiff smile mustering what little strenght they have left.\c
{CHARA:c44}
\e

{BLOCK:14}
Hearing our voices, Tsukishima points his gaze to me.@>
He glares at me with a piercing, gelid, knife-sharp stare.@>
My whole body shivers.@ I feel like my legs will give in and I'll fall inevitably on my rear.@>
With his gaze fixed on me, Tsukishima slowly stands up from his chair.@>
His eyes are completely fuzzy.#

{BLOCK:15}
"Were you...@ the one who took Ruriko away from me...?"@>
Tsukishima says in a hoarse voice.@ He stares at me with contempt and those corpse-like eyes.@>
An unspeakable fear creeps all over my body.@>
My heart starts racing and sweat pours out of my skin, which becomes instantly cold and solidifies, forming grains of salt.#

{BLOCK:16}
{PCMLOAD:12}
"Give her back to me.@ Ruriko is... mine..."@>
This is not something so simple as jealousy or resentment.@>
It's bloodlust.@>
It is, without a shadow of doubt, murderous intent.@>
Tsukishima wants to...@ kill me.\c

{FLASH}
*BZZZT*
{FLASH}
*BRRRM*@>
Electric current races through my head.@>
"Kgh!"@>
A massive amount of electric particles gather around Tsukishima as if absorbed by a black hole.@>
Now that I learned how to feel the flow of the electromagnetic waves, I realize once again how terrible of a monster Tsukishima is.@>
The power of his waves far exceeds my imagination.@>
It's unbelievable...#

{BLOCK:18}
The electric particles focus on a single, small point...@>
situated inside Tsukishima's head.@>
{FLASH}
*Zap!*@>
{FLASH}
*Zap!*@>
Normally, his toxic electromagnetic waves are not visible, but they're now so dense that sparking fireworks start to blast off his body.#

{BLOCK:19}
All the electromagnetic energy focused on his brain takes the shape of a single, uniform wavelength pattern,@>
and he's commanding that pattern to...@>
To...@>
To destroy the mind... of the man before him.@>
That is, me.#

{BLOCK:20}
This is bad.@>
Frightened by his impending killing intent, I've gotten a ridiculously late start.@>
Even if I focused all my electromagnetic waves at full power now, I couldn't possibly muster enough energy to block such a gargantuan attack.@>
That said, I don't have any means to evade toxic waves.@>
I can't believe our fight will end in such a disappointing way...#

{BLOCK:21}
"I'm gonna smash your mind to atoms."@>
These toxic waves carry a colossal amount of energy, so destructive that any miscalculation could end up involving Mizuho and Shinjo, and even Ruriko.@>
However, I can't do anything about it.#

{BLOCK:22}
"GET WRECKED!"@>
{FLASH}
Tsukishima was about to release a blast of super-condensed toxic waves,@>
when...\c
{CHARA:c01}
\e

{BLOCK:23}
"!"@>
Ruriko plants herself firmly before me.@>
She extends her arms in a defensive stance and protects me like a shield.@>
{CHARA:c47}
"R-Ruriko..."@>
Tsukishima halts his electromagnetic attack, and the huge cloud of concentrated energy scatters in the form of sparks.@>
An eerie nervousness takes over as well as a strange silence.#

{BLOCK:24}
"Ruriko...@ Why...?"@>
Tsukishima opens wide his slanted eyes with a surprised expression drawn on his face.@>
Ruriko stays where she is without moving an inch, staring fixedly at Tsukishima with a dejected look.@>
"Are you... covering him, Ruriko?@ Him, instead of me, your brother?@ Him...?@ HIM...?"#

{BLOCK:25}
Ruriko keeps gazing quietly at Tsukishima.@>
{CHARA:c49}
"Uh...!"@>
It seems like something was shaken inside Tsukishima right now.@>
{REFCHAR:L48}
"Uwaaaaaaaah!"@>
Tsukishima screams loudly.@>
He holds his head and cowers on the floor, all while shouting.@>
His voice sounds like an earthquake coming from the bowels of the Earth, fierce enough to tear his chest apart.#

{BLOCK:26}
"K-Kill that guy!@ Make him disappear from my sight!!"@>
{ALLCHAR:L35r36c31}
Reacting to his voice, Ohta and the other two girls stand up abruptly from the floor.@>
They approach me with an awkward gait, just as if they were mechanical dolls.#

{BLOCK:27}
{PCMLOAD:12}
They'll probably come to attack me following loyally Tsukishima's orders.@>
Now free from any physical restraints thanks to his toxic waves, these girls can exert strenght far superior to the average adult man.@>
The three of them working together could beat anyone to death in less than a minute.@>
Their eyes are so cold they don't even give off bloodlust.@ They're completely devoted automatons.@>
These poor girls were transformed into this via Tsukishima's toxic waves.#

{BLOCK:28}
However, now I'm capable of countering those toxic waves by emitting even stronger waves myself.#

{BLOCK:29}
{FLASH}
Electric particles start gathering.@>
The particles become strips and, in turn, the strips turn into waves.@>
I picture the act of "stopping" in my head.@>
Then, all the waves clustered together in my brain transform into a wavelength of "stopping",@>
and I shoot it towards the girls.#

{BLOCK:30}
Ohta, the one closest to me, grabs the neck of my shirt and lifts me up, but at the same time...@>
{PCMPLAY:0100}
{FLASH}
{PCMWAIT}
{PCMSTOP}
{PCMFOUT}
I cover Ohta with plenty of my waves and she stops on her tracks as her body twitches.@>
The other two girls behind her tremble too.#

{BLOCK:31}
{FLASH}
Without a moment's delay, I shoot two waves: "get down" and "sleep".@>
{REFCHAR:r99}
{PCMLOAD:10}
They plummet on the ground very easily under the influence of my waves, and then fall into a comfortable sleep.\c

{BLOCK:32}
This is the first time I have used my electromagnetic waves in others, but it turned out better than I expected.@>
There's no need to learn techniques or practice it.@>
This is something anybody could do as if it were the most natural thing in the world.@>
The only difference would be if the user discovers the correct way to use the waves or not.\c
{CHARA:c44}
\e

{BLOCK:33}
{PCMLOAD:12}
"Can you...@ use electromagnetic waves too?"@>
Tsukishima says, standing up little by little.@>
"That means you..."@>
His black vortex of bloodlust pierces me like a blade.@>

"You had sex...@ with Ruriko!"@>

A dull shock shakes my entire body.@>
I feel like my brain is going to be ripped apart.#

{BLOCK:34}
"You did it with Ruriko, didn't you?!@ Huh?!"@>
Immense, oppresive waves strike me like a tsunami.@>
{FLASH}
Tsukishima's waves are absorbing my soul.@>
"Don't even try to play dumb, because I know!@ I did it with her too!"@>
"W-What did you just say...?"@>
{FLASH}
My field of vision shakes, and my ears ring.@>
My mind, my spirit, my very existence gets crushed and reduced to a pulp like it was thrown in a mixer.#

{BLOCK:35}
"Ruriko is the original user of the electromagnetic waves!@ I learned about their existence through copulating with her!@ Through having sex with her!"@>
{FLASH}
{QUAKE}
A remarkably strong cluster of waves hits my body.@>
It feels like an iron sphere the size of a volleyball ball hitting me right in the head from the rooftop of a 10 stories building.@>
The world sways 100 times more vigorously than suffering seasickness.\c

Tsukishima...@>

Amidst the blinding light, I think I'm hearing Ruriko's voice.@>
Someone embraces me.@>
Brittle shoulders...@ Silky hair...@ Soft bosom...@>
How could I even forget her?@>
This is...@ Ruriko.#

{BLOCK:39}
I cross over the vortex of light.@>
Suddenly, I see myself surrounded by pitch-black darkness,@>
and gradually, my consciousness fades away.#

{BLOCK:40}
*Drip*@>
At a slow pace, tears drip to the puddle on the ground, drawing gentle ripples of light.@>
{VISUAL:259912}
{PCMWAIT}

{PCMFOUT}
Illuminated by the light of the ripples, Ruriko's figure appears in my sight.@>
She wears a sailor uniform with ragged sleeves, her hair is disarranged, and she's crying.#

{BLOCK:41}
The tears trickling down Ruriko's cheeks form bright ripples on the puddle.@>
Those tears dripping endlessly draw wave after wave of light.@>
Ruriko's shoulders tremble as she weeps.\c
{BGMPLAY:01}

{BLOCK:42}
I want to save Ruriko from her pain and sorrow.#

You have it.#

Sitting on the ripples, Ruriko points her gaze at me and speaks in a monotonous tone.#

{BLOCK:48}
Why don't you use "THAT POWER" you've always had?@>
"THAT" one power hidden within you.#

{BLOCK:49}
""That power"?@ What do you mean by "that power"?@ And why would "I" have it?"@>
I ask, but Ruriko stares at me with eyes without any black in them and chuckles.#

Take this.\c
{BG:000011}

Something akin to an enclosed, hot mass breaks its shell and bursts forth.@>
It's similar to a nuclear explosion.#

{BLOCK:55}
That's it!@>
This is the new type of nuke that appeared in my fantasies.@>
It's a bomb capable of setting the world on fire and destroying everything.@>
That's the power hidden inside me: my burning, sticky genocidal impulses.#

{BLOCK:56}
The world before me becomes pure white.@>
It feels like swimming across an ocean of light.#

{BLOCK:57}
"Haa!", I open my eyes.#

{BLOCK:58}
I'm inside the student council room.@>
Without even realizing it, I find myself embracing Ruriko.@>
Tsukishima is in front of me.@>
He looks in my direction with a shocked expression on his face.@>
A freakish mug as if he just witnessed something unbelievable, like a UFO or a ghost.#

{BLOCK:59}
What is he so surpised about?@>
I just noticed it, but a monumental amount of waves that greatly surpass Tsukishima swirl around me.@>
Oh, I see.@>
I'm sure now...@>
that THIS is what has Tsukishima so flabbergasted.\c
