{BGMPLAY:01}
I feel like this is all an illusion, but with unwavering focus, I head to the student council once again.@>
In order to defeat Tsukishima...@>
In order of put an end to all this...@>
I have finally acquired the power to make it possible.@>
The power of electromagnetic waves.\c
{BG:180000}
\e

{BLOCK:1}
Without realizing it, I find myself grabbing the knob of the student council room.@>
Once I open this door and enter, I'll confront Tsukishima face to face.@>
One of us will have his spirit destroyed, and undoubtely be rendered disabled for life.@>
We could not only lose our minds, but our spirits might be completely destroyed and we could become vegetables.@>
Only our flesh would be left, while our souls would be obliterated.#

{BLOCK:2}
However, that's exactly what I'm aiming for.@>
If I win and Tsukishima is destroyed, I can save Mizuho and Shinjo.@>
His deranged ambition will be stopped, and he'll pay at least a little for the sins he commited against Ohta and the other girls.@>
On the other hand, if Tsukishima is victorious and I'm defeated...#

{BLOCK:3}
I'll finally be released from this long, painful nightmare.#

{BLOCK:4}
When I wake up tomorrow in the same bed I always sleep in, I'll turn off my alarm clock as I do every single day.@>
And then...@ I'll go to school to take those lessons akin to a silent, monochrome film.@>
Stupid classes that make me die of boredom...\c
{BG:191010}
\e

{BLOCK:5}
I slowly open the door and enter the student council room.\c
{BG:141010}
\e

{BLOCK:6}
As always, the room is dim inside.@>
At first I thought nobody was here, but that was merely a groundless supposition.@>
Sweat and sexual fluids dripping...@>
Faint traces of amonnia stench...@>
And several pale, naked girls lying flabbily on the ground.@>
Exhausted, they rest on the floor in exactly the same position than when their act was interrupted.@>
It's almost as if time freezed when I jumped out of the room.#

{BLOCK:7}
As for Tsukishima...@>
He's sitting on a folding chair, bracing his knees and quivering.\c
{CHARA:c49}
\e

{BLOCK:8}
"I'm sorry@ Ruriko@ I didn't mean to do that@ forgive me Ruriko@ I love you@ I don't want anyone but you@ we were always alone, weren't we?@ You're the only one in my life@ Ruriko@ Ruriko@ Ruriko@ please don't abandon me@ don't go away from me@ let's keep going only the two of us forever and ever@ against wind and tide@ I swear I'll protect you Ruriko..."#

{BLOCK:9}
In a voice devoid of all inflection, Tsukishima keeps mumbling sentences without any punctuation marks as if it were a sutra.@>
His eyes look muddy, corrupt, and his pupils darkened and dull.@>
He stares intently at a fixed point in the floor as he repeats himself endlessly.\c
{CHARA:c99}
\e

{BLOCK:10}
"Yuu... suke..."@>
I hear a faint voice calling my name.@>
It's Mizuho.@>
With a worn-out body, she lifts her head and looks in my direction.@>
"Nagase..."@>
Just like Mizuho, Shinjo points her face to me after hearing her voice.@>
As if they had spent until the very last drop of their energy, they can't even get up by themselves.#

{BLOCK:11}
They were trapped inside this abnormal domain and forced to perform indecent, disgraceful acts.@>
Tsukishima's toxic electromagnetic waves increased several times the sensivity of their bodies and pushed them way past their limit.@>
All of them are, quite literally, dead tired.@>
"Don't worry.@ It'll all end soon."@>
I say a bit languidly, and both of them gaze at me silently with solemn looks on their faces.#

{BLOCK:12}
Hearing our voices, Tsukishima directs his gaze towards me.@>
He glares at me with a piercing, gelid, knife-sharp stare.@>
With his gaze fixed on me, he slowly stands up from his chair.@>
His eyes are completely fuzzy.\c
{BGMFOUT}
{BGMWAIT}
{BGMPLAY:19}
{CHARA:c44}
\e

{BLOCK:13}
"Were you...@ the one who took Ruriko away from me...?"@>
Tsukishima says in a hoarse voice.@ He stares at me with contempt and those corpse-like eyes.@>
Surrounding him is a vortex of black, sinister energy.@>
That low-hanging darkness of insanity glues somberly to my skin.#

{BLOCK:14}
"Give her back to me.@ Ruriko is... mine..."@>
This is not something so simple as jealousy or resentment.@>
It's bloodlust.@>
It's plain to see that Tsukishima wants to kill me,@>
and the same goes for me.#

{BLOCK:15}
Illuminated by uncanny moonlight, Tsukishima's face looks as repulsive as a specter.@>
"I'm gonna...@ take Ruriko back."@>
He says with a cold voice.@>
{ALLCHAR:c31l35r36}
Reacting to his voice, Ohta and the other two girls stand up abruptly from the floor.@>
They approach me with an awkward gait, just as if they were mechanical dolls.#
"Everyone, kill that guy."#

{BLOCK:16}
{PCMLOAD:12}
They'll probably come to attack me following loyally Tsukishima's orders.@>
Now free from any physical restraints thanks to his toxic waves, these girls can exert strenght far superior to the average adult man.@>
The three of them working together could beat anyone to death in less than a minute.@>
Their eyes are so cold they don't even give off bloodlust.@ They're completely devoted automatons.@>
These poor girls were transformed into this via Tsukishima's toxic waves.#

{BLOCK:17}
However, now I'm capable of countering those toxic waves by emitting even stronger waves myself.#

{BLOCK:18}
{FLASH}
Electric particles start gathering.@>
The particles become strips and, in turn, the strips turn into waves.@>
I picture the act of "stopping" in my head.@>
Then, all the waves clustered together in my brain transform into a wavelength of "stopping",@>
and I shoot it towards the girls.#

{BLOCK:19}
Ohta, the one closest to me, grabs the neck of my shirt and lifts me up, but at the same time...@>
{PCMPLAY:0100}
{FLASH}
{PCMWAIT}
{PCMSTOP}
I cover Ohta with plenty of my waves and she stops on her tracks as her body twitches.@>
The other two girls behind her tremble too.#

{BLOCK:20}
Without a moment's delay, I shoot two waves: "get down" and "sleep".@>
{PCMPLAY:0100}
{FLASH}
{PCMWAIT}
{PCMSTOP}
{PCMFOUT}
{PCMLOAD:10}
They plummet on the ground very easily under the influence of my waves, and then fall into a comfortable sleep.\c

{BLOCK:21}
This is the first time I use my electromagnetic waves in others, but I have confidence in my abilities.@>
It turned out well in the end.@>
There's no need to learn techniques or practice it.@>
This is something anybody could do as if it were the most natural thing in the world.@>
The only difference would be if the user discovers the correct way to use the waves or not.\c
{CHARA:c44}
\e

{BLOCK:22}
"Can you...@ use electromagnetic waves too?"@>
Tsukishima says coldly in a whisper.@>
The electric particles focus on a single, small point...@>
situated inside Tsukishima's head.@>

{BLOCK:23}
All the electromagnetic energy focused on his brain takes the shape of a single, uniform wavelength pattern,@>
and he's commanding that pattern to...@>
To...@>
To destroy the mind... of the man before him.@>
That is, me.#

{FLASH}
*Zap!*@>
{FLASH}
*Zap!*@>
Normally, his toxic electromagnetic waves are not visible, but they're now so dense that sparking fireworks start to blast off his body.#

{BLOCK:24}
{PCMLOAD:12}
"That means you..."@>
His black vortex of bloodlust pierces me like a blade.@>
{CHARA:c43}
"You had sex...@ with Ruriko!"@>
{PCMPLAY:0100}
{FLASH}
{PCMWAIT}
{PCMSTOP}
*FWOOOM!*@ The next instant, he attacks me with tempestuous waves.#

{BLOCK:25}
I focus my waves on the fly too and release them.@>
{PCMPLAY:0100}
{FLASH}
{PCMWAIT}
{PCMSTOP}
The waves I shoot repel Tsukishima's attack.@>
It's a clash between two dark souls.@>
{FLASH}
{FLASH}
*BZZZT*@ *BZZZT*@ A phenomenon of electrical discharges arises in the air.#

{BLOCK:26}
"You did it with Ruriko, didn't you?!@ Huh?!"@>
Immense, oppresive waves assault me like a tsunami.@>
It's an overwhelming amount of waves.@>
"Don't even try to play dumb, because I know!@ I did it with her too!"@>
My electromagnetic waves are pushed back by his.@>
Eventually, they hit me like a flash flood after the collapse of a broken dam.#

{BLOCK:27}
{FLASH}
{QUAKE}
A shock runs through my whole body.@>
I feel like my brain is going to be torn apart.@>
My field of vision shakes, and my ears ring.@>
Tsukishima's electromagnetic waves absorb my soul.@>
My mind, my spirit, my very existence gets crushed and reduced to a pulp like it was thrown in a mixer.#

{BLOCK:28}
"Ruriko is the original user of the electromagnetic waves!@ I learned about their existence through copulating with her!@ Through having sex with her!"@>
{FLASH}
{QUAKE}
A remarkably strong cluster of waves hits my body.@>
It feels like an iron sphere the size of a volleyball ball hitting me right in the head from the rooftop of a 10 stories building.@>
The world sways 100 times more vigorously than suffering seasickness.#

{BLOCK:29}
"I'm gonna smash your mind to atoms."@>
{PCMPLAY:0100}
{PCMWAIT}
{PCMSTOP}
These toxic waves carry a colossal amount of energy, so destructive that any miscalculation could end up involving Mizuho and Shinjo, and even Ruriko.@>
However, I can't do anything about it.#

{BLOCK:30}
"GET WRECKED!"@>
Tsukishima is about to release a blast of super-condensed toxic waves.\c

{BLOCK:31}
Will I lose just like this?@>
Will my soul be destroyed?@>
What will I find after meeting my end?@>
Will this simply end up as a dream?@>
Will I meet another of those mornings I'm so used to experience, where the alarm clock rings loudly as I lie on my bed?@>
Or else...?\c
{PCMLOAD:17}
\e

{BLOCK:32}
The world before my eyes becomes pure white.@>
Tsukishima...@ is swallowed by the light.\c
{BGMPLAY:01}
\e

{BLOCK:33}
Naga...#

{BLOCK:34}
Amidst the blinding light, I think I heard Ruriko calling my name.#

{BLOCK:35}
I cross over the vortex of light.@>
Suddenly, I see myself surrounded by pitch-black darkness,@>
and gradually, my consciousness fades away.#

{BLOCK:36}
*Drip*@>
At a slow pace, tears drip to the puddle on the ground, drawing gentle ripples of light.@>
Illuminated by the light of the ripples, Ruriko's figure appears in my sight.@>
{VISUAL:259912}
She wears a sailor uniform with ragged sleeves, her hair is disarranged, and she's crying.#

{BLOCK:37}
The tears trickling down Ruriko's cheeks form bright ripples on the puddle.@>
Those tears dripping endlessly draw wave after wave of light.@>
Ruriko's shoulders tremble as she weeps.\c
{PCMWAIT}
{PCMSTOP}
{PCMFOUT}
\e

{BLOCK:38}
Poor Ruriko...@ Her body and heart are torn into pieces.@>
She has been defiled.@>
Having lost everything and trapped inside the darkness, she keeps shedding tears restlessly.#

{BLOCK:39}
I want to save her.@>
I want to stop her tears.\c
{VISUAL:269912}
{BGMFOUT}
{BGMWAIT}
\e

{BLOCK:40}
"Save me?@ Stop my tears?@ What are you talking about? You were the one who hurt me, Naga."@>
Sitting on the ripples, Ruriko points her gaze at me and speaks in a monotonous tone.#

{BLOCK:41}
{FLASH}
"UWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!!!"#

{BLOCK:42}
Something explodes inside me.#

{BLOCK:43}
Something akin to an enclosed hot mass breaks its shell and burst out.@>
It's like a nuclear explosion.@>
The power hidden within me...@>
My burning, sticky genocidal impulses.#

{BLOCK:44}
The world before me becomes pure white.@>
It feels like swimming across an ocean of light.#

{BLOCK:45}
"Haa!", I open my eyes.#

{BLOCK:46}
I'm inside the student council room.@>
Tsukishima is in front of me.@>
He looks in my direction with a shocked expression on his face.@>
A freakish mug as if he just witnessed something unbelievable, like a UFO or a ghost.#

{BLOCK:47}
What is he so surpised about?@>
I just noticed it, but a monumental amount of waves that greatly surpass Tsukishima swirl around me.@>
Oh, I see.@>
I'm sure now...@>
that THIS is what has Tsukishima so flabbergasted.\c
