{PCMLOAD:12}
I feel like I'm inside of one of the fantasies I dream about in class.@>
A foggy state of mind...@>
Shivers fierce enough to make my hair stand on end...@>
A drug-like delight where I have overwhelming power and can control the lives of other people on the palm of my hand...@>
Blood-pounding pleasure.#

{BLOCK:1}
　
{FLASH}
*¡Bzzzt!* 
{FLASH}
*¡Bzzzt!*@>
Several flashes of purple lightning travel across the air.@>
With the power I have now, I could break Tsukishima's mind as easily as smashing an unglazed pottery bottle in pieces tossing it on the ground.\c
{CHARA:c43}
\e

{BLOCK:2}
"D-Dammit!"@>
Tsukishima gathers his electromagnetic waves almost at full capacity.@>
Until just a moment ago I feared his unlimited power, but now I can't help but think of this battle as child's play.@>
Tsukishima releases all his waves at once to attack me.\c
{PCMPLAY:0100}
{FLASH}
{PCMWAIT}
\e

{BLOCK:3}
However, the waves he fires vanish before mine as if they were absorbed, since mine are orders of magnitude more powerful.@>
{CHARA:c47}
"I-Impossible!@ This can't be happening..."@>
{CHARA:c43}
{FLASH}
{FLASH}
Tsukishima repeats his struggle again and again in vain, for all his attacks end up with exactly the same result.@>
His electromagnetic waves never reach my brain.@>
{CHARA:c47}
"This is ridiculous!@ I...@ I..."#

{BLOCK:4}
At that moment, my outstandingly huge waves start to incline towards him.@>
{FLASH}
{FLASH}
Not even I can control them anymore.@>
The waves fall over Tsukishima like a downpour of rain.@>
This scene reminds me of the Niagara falls.@>
{REFCHAR:L48}
"Uuh!@ Uwah!@ UWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH..."#

*Doom-Doom-Doom-Doom-Doom-Doom*@>
My electromagnetic waves approach him like surging waves and break through the wall in his heart.@>
Tsukishima is able to resist normal waves, but he can't endure even a second of this overwhelming amount of energy.@>
Tsukishima's defenses are destroyed in the blink of an eye, and his fragile spirit gets stripped naked.#

{BLOCK:6}
My electromagnetic waves assault his mind mercilessly,@>
destroying his mind from inside out.#

{BLOCK:7}
His eyes, his ears, his mouth, his skin, his skull...@>
My waves penetrate every corner of his body.#

{BLOCK:8}
My consciousness leaves my body and assimilates with Tsukishima.@>
Red, blue, green...@ Lights of several colors sparkle as my mind enters Tsukishima's soul at a slow pace.\c

{BLOCK:9}
*Dun-Dun-Dun-Dun*@>
*Dun-Dun-Dun-Dun*@>
I'm entering...@>
Tsukishima's heart.\c
{BGMPLAY:01}
\e

{BLOCK:10}
It's cold.@>
My skin comes in contact with the chilly air, and I slowly open my eyes.@>
"Haa..."@ I exhale a white puff.#

{BLOCK:11}
This is a completely dark, pitch-black world, without even the faintest ray of light.@>
The pits of hell...@ That term would describe it perfectly.#

{BLOCK:12}
I think...@>
it looks similar.@>
This looks much the same as Ruriko's heart.#

{BLOCK:13}
Is this really Tsukishima's heart?@>
There's nothing here.@>
Literally not a single thing...@>
in this world of pure black...#

{BLOCK:14}
In space, there's the glimmer of stars.@>
In a desert, there's the hot sand fluttering in the wind.@>
But here...@ here's nothing BUT empty darkness.#

{BLOCK:15}
Floating in space, I wander about this vast, unlighted realm.\c
{VISUAL:231100}
\e

{BLOCK:16}
Eventually, out of the blue, I find a wooden bed standing alone in the darkness.@>
There's a single kid sitting on it bracing his knees.@>
It's a small boy.@>
*Drip*@ *Drip*@ He's stopping his ears with both hands in fear of something as he sheds large teardrops.#

{BLOCK:17}
I approach the bed and talk to him quietly.@>
"What's wrong?@ Why are you crying?"@>
I talk to him ever so gently so that he doesn't get scared.@>
The boy slowly lifts his head and lowers his hands covering his ears.@>
*Fwip*@ *Fwip*@ He wipes his tears from both of his eyes.#

{BLOCK:18}
"Who are you?"@>
The boy asks with a voice mix of tears and sobbing.@>
"I'm Yuusuke, and you?"@>
"Takuya.@ Takuya... Tsukishima."@>
The boy...@ Little Tsukishima introduces himself politely.@>
I know it's him...@>
because this is his mental world.#

{BLOCK:19}
"Why are you crying?@ What makes you so sad?"@>
I ask him siting before him and looking him in the eye.@>
Little Tsukishima hangs his head dejectedly.@>
"Ruriko...@ My little sister... Ruriko...@ is gone..."@>
Trembling from the cold, Tsukishima braces his knees and curls himself into a ball.#

{BLOCK:20}
"We used to be...@ always... together...@ but now..."@>
Once again, Tsukishima becomes weepy and rubs his tearful eyes with the back of his hand.@>
"I'm...@ sick of this...@ I'm tired of being...@ all alone..."@>
Tsukishima says, but then startles and immediately stops his ears again.#

{BLOCK:21}
"Aah..."@>
I hear the moaning voice of a woman coming from somewhere.@>
"Aah...@ Nh..."@>
Sensual, lustful howls.@>
That typical satisfied voice women let out during sex.@>
"Aah!"@>
Those moans, echoing slightly, resound like they're coming from the bowels of the Earth.@>
Perhaps frightened by that, Little Tsukishima curls himself up quivering.#

{BLOCK:22}
"Ruriko...@ Where... are you...?@ I don't wanna...@ be alone...@ anymore..."@>
Tsukishima covers his ears and crouches down on the bed.@ His body keeps twitching just like a small puppy wet from rain.#

{BLOCK:23}
"Ruriko left...@ because you hurt her.@ Isn't that right?"@>
I say in a cold voice.#

{BLOCK:24}
Squatting while closing his ears, little Tsukishima directs his weeping gaze towards me.@>
"I...@ apologized...@ to Ruriko.@ I asked her for forgiveness over and over again."@>
Tsukishima's eyes overflow with tears.@>
"Isn't that enough...@ for Ruriko to forgive me?"#

{BLOCK:25}
What will I do?\n\e

{BLOCK:26}
{XPOS:6}
{SPEED:0}
1. "Don't try to justify yourself!"\n\e

{BLOCK:27}
{XPOS:6}
{SPEED:0}
2. "He's a victim, too..."\n\e
