I feel like I'm inside of one of the fantasies I dream about in class.@>
A foggy state of mind...@>
Shivers fierce enough to make my hair stand on end...@>
A drug-like delight where I have overwhelming power and can control the lives of other people on the palm of my hand...@>
Blood-pounding pleasure.#

{BLOCK:1}
　
{FLASH}
*¡Bzzzt!* 
{FLASH}
*¡Bzzzt!*@>
Several flashes of purple lightning travel across the air.@>
With the power I have now, I could break Tsukishima's mind as easily as smashing an unglazed pottery bottle in pieces tossing it on the ground.\c

"I-Impossible!"@>

{FLASH}

{PCMSTOP}
Tsukishima gathers his electromagnetic waves almost at full capacity.@>
Until just a moment ago I feared his unlimited power, but now I can't help but think of this battle as child's play.@>
Tsukishima releases all his waves at once to attack me.#

{BLOCK:3}
{FLASH}
However, the waves he fires vanish before mine as if they were absorbed, since mine are orders of magnitude more powerful.@>
{CHARA:c43}
"T-This can't be happening...!"@>
Tsukishima repeats his struggle again and again in vain.@>
{FLASH}
{FLASH}
However, all his attacks end up with exactly the same result.@>
His electromagnetic waves never reach my brain.@>
{CHARA:c47}
"This is ridiculous!@ I...@ I..."#

{BLOCK:4}
At that moment, my outstandingly huge waves start to incline towards him.@>
Not even I can control them anymore.@>
The waves fall over Tsukishima like a downpour of rain.@>

{REFCHAR:L48}
This scene reminds me of the Niagara falls.@>
"Uuh!@ Uwah!@ UWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH..."#

{BLOCK:5}
*Doom-Doom-Doom-Doom-Doom-Doom*@>
My electromagnetic waves approach him like surging waves and break through the wall in his heart.@>
Tsukishima is able to resist normal waves, but he can't endure even a second of this overwhelming amount of energy.@>
Tsukishima's defenses are destroyed in the blink of an eye, and his fragile spirit gets stripped naked.#

{BLOCK:6}
My electromagnetic waves assault his mind mercilessly,@>
destroying his mind from inside out.@>
His eyes, his ears, his mouth, his skin, his skull...@>
My waves penetrate every corner of his body.#

{BLOCK:7}

Tsukishima's agonizing cry of death sounds extremely pleasant to my ears.#
