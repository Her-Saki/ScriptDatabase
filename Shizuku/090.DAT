{BLOCK:0}
I quietly reach out my hand to little Tsukishima, who stares blankly at it with his eyes full of tears.#

{BLOCK:1}
"C'mon."@>
I move my hand even closer to Tsukishima.@>
At first he was hesitant, but upon seeing my smile, he lowers his guard a little and timidly grabs my hand.#

{BLOCK:2}
Tsukishima's little hand holds mine.@>
I pull it back slowly and make him stand up.@>
"You have to take responsibility for your actions."@>
"Responsi... bility?"@>
Little Tsukishima repeats fearfully.@>
"You must atone for hurting Ruriko and everyone else."@>
I pull Tsukishima by the hand and get him out of bed.#

{BLOCK:3}
"Okay, I'll atone.@ Would that make Ruriko forgive me?@ Would she come back here?"@>
Little Tsukishima tries his best to smile as he wipes his tears.#

{BLOCK:4}
"I...@ don't think Ruriko will return here ever again."@>
I say in a cold voice.@>
"W-Why?"@>
"Stop making Ruriko suffer already!"@>
Little Tsukishima steps back in fear.@>
However, I never let go of him.#

{BLOCK:5}
"Tsukishima...@ You're to blame for everything.@ Do you have the faintest idea how much pain your weak heart brought to Ruriko?!"@>
As I say that, I pull back his hand roughly.@>
"Ah!"@>
"Get destroyed, you scumbag.@ Stay here crying for the rest of your fucking life!"#

{BLOCK:6}
{PCMLOAD:13}
I yank little Tsukishima forcefully, and immediately throw him in the opposite direction.@>
"Ah!"@ Tsukishima lets out a short-lived cry, and falls to the ground facing upwards.\c

*CRASH!*@>
As soon as he collides with the hard floor, his body breaks in pieces like a figurine made of glass.@>
His arms, his legs, his torso, his sorrowful eyes turn into small fragments and fly around everywhere.@>
This means his soul itself was destroyed.#

{BLOCK:8}
"Ruriko...@ Forgive...@ me..."#

{BLOCK:9}
I think that's what he whispered in the very instant he got demolished.#

{BLOCK:10}
The tiny shards shine like gems, and just like light snow falling in the palm of one's hand, they melt until finally disappearing.@>
All that is left is this starless, cold, vast darkness.#

{BLOCK:11}
Via my electromagnetic waves, I got to the very core of Tsukishima's emotional pain.@>
His spirit crumbles down with a sound.@>
That said, it's nothing majestic like the rumbling of a large tower collapsing; it's merely an abrupt, unsatisfying sound, like a thin thread snapping.@>
After all, the human mind is as fragile as glassware.@>
Something you can easily break with just a slight hit.\c

{BLOCK:12}
After coming back from Tsukishima's mind, I feel a faint warmth between my arms.@>
Realizing it's Ruriko's body warmth, a sense of relief washes over me, as if I came back to a long-missed hometown.@>
I open quietly my eyelids.@>
I'm inside the gloomy student council room.@>
It seems I was embracing Ruriko by the shoulders the whole time during my astral projection.\c
{VISUAL:051010}

{BLOCK:13}
In front of me is...@ Tsukishima.@>
He's sitting on the floor, resting tiredly his upper body against the wall.@>
His eyes slightly opened have lost all life in them, dull like those of a dead fish.#

{BLOCK:14}
His pupils are gradually losing their color.@>
Eventually, he melts into the realm of insanity as restfully as if he fell asleep.@>
As for his expression, he keeps smiling all the time just like a pure, innocent child.#

{BLOCK:15}
I take a look around the room.@>
Due to the influence of our super clash of electromagnetic waves, Mizuho and Shinjo are both knocked out cold.@>
On the other hand, Ohta and her friends are asleep since I ordered them to rest with my waves.@>
The room is quiet and silent.#

{BLOCK:16}
"Ruriko..."@>
I embrace Ruriko's slim shoulders and gently stroke her silky hair and her cheeks.@>
"This was for the best.@ Now...@ nobody will hurt you anymore."@>
However, Ruriko doesn't answer anything.#

{BLOCK:17}
Ruriko stares at Tsukishima.@>
Tears spill from her eyes fixed on him.@>
Her teardrops slide slowly along her pale cheeks, and fall to the floor.#

{BLOCK:18}
"I...@ have already forgiven you, brother."@>
Ruriko whispers in a low voice.#

{BLOCK:19}
Ruriko continues to gaze at Tsukishima as she sheds pearly teardrops endlessly.\c
