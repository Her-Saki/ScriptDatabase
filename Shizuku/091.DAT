{BLOCKLEN:22}

{BLOCK:0}
Tsukishima's body trembles uncontrollably as his spirit crumbles down audibly.@>
That said, it's nothing majestic like the rumbling of a large tower collapsing; it's merely an abrupt, unsatisfying sound, like a thin thread snapping.@>
After all, the human mind is as fragile as glassware.@>
Something you can easily break with just a slight hit.#

{BLOCK:1}
"Ruriko...@ Forgive...@ me..."@>
Those were his last words.@>
{VISUAL:051010}
Tsukishima slides down the wall until collapsing on the floor, resting tiredly his upper body against the wall.@>
His eyes slightly opened have lost all life in them, dull like those of a dead fish.#

{BLOCK:2}
His pupils are gradually losing their color.@>
Eventually, he melts into the realm of insanity as restfully as if he fell asleep.@>
As for his expression, he keeps smiling all the time just like a pure, innocent child.#

{BLOCK:3}
"It's over..."@>
I fall to the floor too, like a puppet whose threads snapped.@>
It's all over.@>
My electromagnetic waves expanded greatly at the last moment, fought back Tsukishima's ones with overwhelming power, and pushed him down to the abyss of destruction all at once.#

{BLOCK:4}
Leaning his torso against the wall, Tsukishima wears an innocent smile on his face as he stares at a fixed point in space.@>
Both his spirit and his persona have been completely obliterated.@>
He's now a human vegetable,@>
and he'll likely never recover from this.#

{BLOCK:5}
I think he got his just desserts.@ After all the damage he has done to so many people, he DESERVED to be destroyed.#

{BLOCK:6}
No, actually, his spirit was on the verge of destruction from the very start.@>
Tormented by his sins, he was walking straight along the path of doom.@>
A nightmare that could end at any time.@>
And now, I'm walking the same path as him.#

{BLOCK:7}
After defiling Shinjo, Mizuho and Ruriko, Tsukishima (like a true reflection of myself) ended up buried into the darkness.#

{BLOCK:8}
Please...@ Someone wake me up from this dream...#

{BLOCK:9}
I look around at the room absent-mindedly...@>
until spotting Mizuho and Shinjo in my field of vision.#

{BLOCK:10}
What in the world happened to them?#

{BLOCK:11}
Both of them are lying down quivering in a corner of the room.@>
Not only them.@ The student council girls that were sleeping just a moment ago are shaking.@>
Ohta is the only one that remains quiet.\c
{BGMPLAY:21}
\e

{BLOCK:12}
For some reason, they look very funny to me.@ "Huhu", I laugh.@>
"What's wrong, everybody?@ Huhuhu...@ You're acting weird"#

{BLOCK:13}
"Ah,@ ah,@ ah,@ ah,@ ah,@ ah,@ ah,@ ah,@ ah,@ ah,@ ah,@ ah,@ ah,@ ah,@ ah,@ ah,@ ah,@ ah,@ ah,@ ah,@ ah..."@>
Drool drips loosely from Mizuho's mouth.@>
"No more,@ I'm sick of it,@ no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no..."@>
Shinjo repeats the word "no" like a broken CD as her body jerks and she urinates herself.#

{BLOCK:14}
{PCMLOAD:12}
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no!@ Stop the@ electromagnetic waves..."
{FLASH}
@>
Shinjo was exclaiming "no, no" loudly, but as soon as she shouted that, she became suddenly still and fell silent.#

{BLOCK:15}
{FLASH}
{FLASH}
Oh, I see.@>
I forgot to stop the electromagnetic waves.@>
I was still releasing them without noticing it.#

{BLOCK:16}
{PCMPLAY:0100}
{FLASH}
{PCMWAIT}
{PCMSTOP}
As my waves run amok, they become increasingly large and stronger.@>
It's like an electromagnetic typhoon blowing wildly.#

{BLOCK:17}
Wow, I didn't know my waves were so powerful.#

{BLOCK:18}
{PCMPLAY:0100}
{FLASH}
{PCMWAIT}
{PCMSTOP}
{PCMFOUT}
I'm amazed at the power of my own waves, which grow bigger and bigger like they're doing it on their own, just for fun.#

{BLOCK:19}
"H-@H-@H-@H-@H-@e-@e-@e-@e-@e-@l-@l-@l-@l-@l-@p-@p-@p-@p-@p@ m-@m-@m-@m-@m-@e-@e-@e-@e-@e- Y-@Y-@Y-@Y-@Y-@u-@u-@u-@u-@u-@s-@s-@s-@s-@s-@u-@u-@u-@u-@u-@k-@k-@k-@k-@k-@e-@e-@e-@e-@e-@ H-@H-@H-@H-@H-@e-@e-@e-@e-@e-@l-@l-@l-@l-@l-@p-@p-@p-@p-@p..."#

{BLOCK:20}
Mizuho, whose body shivers wildly, utters some strange words as she leaks drool and pisses herself.#

{BLOCK:21}
I gaze idly at her.@ While I do think that's dirty, I wonder how much powerful my waves can get...\c
