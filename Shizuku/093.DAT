*Click! Click!*@ I stretch the lead of my mechanical pencil again and again as I let it run meaninglessly through my notebook, until eventually, the lead breaks apart and some specks hit my cheek.#

{BLOCK:1}
The sluggish wind swaying the beige curtains makes this classroom feel even more like a scene from a silent, colorless film, completely removed from reality.#

{BLOCK:2}
Inside the classroom, lit by the afternoon sun, dead-eyed students write down rows upon rows of notes as they gulp in great lungfuls of chalk dust.#

{BLOCK:3}
And thus, the incident has quietly come to an end.#

{BLOCK:4}
Now I am the only person left who has any recollection of it.#

{BLOCK:5}
I deleted Mizuho and Shinjo's memories with my electromagnetic waves.@
Part of the reason was that I didn't want anything about the toxic waves to go public, but also because the girls don't have any reason to suffer remembering the abhorrent things they went through.@
I think that was the last time I'll ever use my electromagnetic waves.#

{BLOCK:6}
The student council girls lost their memories right after waking up since they were only mind-controlled from the start.@
Perhaps they got surprised at their amnesia after reaching home.#

{BLOCK:7}
Ohta, who returned to the hospital, was later transferred to a psych ward.@
The seemingly meaningful diary she left behind was written off as a delusion caused by her hallucinatory state.@
According to some rumors, she's beyond all hope of recovery.#

{BLOCK:8}
And as for Tsukishima and Ruriko...@
They're...@ not here anymore.\c
{BGMFOUT}
{BGMWAIT}
{BG:000011}
\e

{BLOCK:9}
That day, I carried Tsukishima on my back and accompanied both of them home.@
A cold night wind blew.@
As we walked along the dark, long road, Tsukishima and I didn't exchange a single word.@
I think it wasn't because we were at a loss for words, but because we didn't want to think about anything anymore.\c
{BGMPLAY:12}
\e

{BLOCK:10}
Ruriko's home was covered in darkness with all the lights out.@
It was a neat, yet not very livable, bleak residence.#

{BLOCK:11}
Ruriko opened the entrance gate and escorted me inside.@
The door wasn't locked, but regardless, there was no sign of anyone home.@
I dropped Tsukishima near the entrance.@
Ruriko stood up by the gloomy door, and without even turning on the lights, she stared at me fixedly as I let Tsukishima slide down along my back.@
Her uniform illuminated by the moonlight looked soft and radiant at a time.#

{BLOCK:12}
As I was about to go home, Ruriko said:@
"Thank you, Naga."@
While indeed a brief farewell, it was enough for me to feel her gratitude.@
Gentle moonlight shone upon us like a spotlight.@
"Good night, Ruriko.@ See you tomorrow at school."@
I said waving a hand slightly.\c
{VISUAL:111100}
\e

{BLOCK:13}
Ruriko approached me quietly and gave me a lukewarm, surface level kiss.@
Just like a scene of a fairy tale, that lapse of time felt very mysterious.@
I was enveloped by a sleep-inducing relief.@
I'd rather just forget everything and rot away next to her for all eternity.@
Forget it all, and...#

{BLOCK:14}
Feeling Ruriko's glance piercing my back, I left her home behind.\c
{BGMFOUT}
{BGMWAIT}
{BG:000011}
\e

{BLOCK:15}
The next day, Ruriko didn't come to school.@
Nor the next day, either.#

{BLOCK:16}
I thought she was having a hard time dealing with her brother's problems, but regardless, I couldn't help but feel concerned.#

{BLOCK:17}
And the next day, Sunday, I dropped directly by Ruriko's home.#

{BLOCK:18}
Soon after I rang the bell of the door, a sort of housekeeper came out and told me Ruriko wasn't there.@
When I asked her for Ruriko's whereabouts, she made a sad face and told me the full story.\c
{BGMPLAY:10}
{BG:210000}
\e

{BLOCK:19}
Ruriko is sleeping peacefully along with her brother in a room of the general hospital where their uncle works.#

{BLOCK:20}
"Ruriko...?"@
I tried talking to her, but she was asleep, and didn't answer in the slightest.@
I observed her peaceful sleeping face...@
The quiet sound of her breath...@
Her chest going up and down serenely as she rested on the bed of that pale room.#

{BLOCK:21}
I know all too well how they ended up like this.@
Ruriko went with his brother to keep him company.@
She closed her own heart and traveled to Tsukishima's mental world; to that realm of darkness where he was always crying in solitude.\c
{VISUAL:240606}
\e

{BLOCK:22}
All this time they relied only on each other.@
As her other half, so to speak, Ruriko couldn't leave her brother alone.@
Just like when they were kids, they stayed cuddling close together in that dark, frozen abyss.\c
{BG:210505}
\e

{BLOCK:23}
Standing still in the hospital room, I thought I just heard Ruriko's voice.\c
{BG:000011}
\e

{BLOCK:24}
"Sorry, Naga.@ I still love you."\c
{BG:211100}
\e

{BLOCK:25}
I startled, lifted my face, and looked at Ruriko sleeping on the bed.@
However, all my eyes met was same picture as always.#

{BLOCK:26}
When I exited the room, I turned around near the entrance to see them one last time.@
The bright rays of the spring sun coming through the window dyed the room a faint cream color.@
Inside that warm room, their expressions as they slept so quietly looked very much placid.\c
{BGMNEXT:02}
{BGMFOUT}
{BG:010000}
\e

{BLOCK:27}
An emotionless teacher reads a text in a language I don't comprehend.@>
The sound of the students running their pens across their notebooks mixes with the sound of the teacher hitting the blackboard with the chalk.#

{BLOCK:28}
Afterwards, the world has never lost its sound and color again.@
The real world is as boring as always, but strangely, I feel oddly fulfilled.#

{BLOCK:29}
I look out the window with an absent-minded face.@
All while thinking about Ruriko...\c
{BGMFOUT}
{BGMWAIT}
{VISUAL:240505}
\e

{BLOCK:30}
I wonder if Ruriko and Tsukishima are trembling as they embrace each other in that glacial, lightless void.@
I wonder if they're waiting on that wooden bed for a dawn that will never come...\c
{BGMPLAY:02}
{BG:010505}
\e

{BLOCK:31}
From beyond the beige curtains swaying gently, a soft breeze blows along with the warm sunlight.@
The sun's rays reflecting off the glass are projected on the ceiling of the classroom, drawing radiant flowers of light.@
That's beautiful...@
I had no idea the world was always such a wonderful place.\c
{VISUAL:270303}
\e

{BLOCK:32}
In today's lunch break, I head to the rooftop where I first talked with Ruriko.@
I pass by Mizuho on my way through the hallway.@
I walk right by her side, but she ignores me and keeps talking cheerfully with her friends next to her.@
She probably doesn't remember me, and much less my face.@
When I stop on my tracks, she turns around the corner and I continue to observe her from behind until she vanishes from my sight.\c
{BGMNEXT:10}
{BGMFOUT}
{BG:340303}
\e

{BLOCK:33}
A pleasant breeze blows in the rooftop.@
I gaze at the urban landscape below the fence.@
Enveloped by the radiant rays of the afternoon sun, the world itself makes me feel the signs of spring approaching.\c
{BG:000011}
\e

{BLOCK:34}
"Did my waves reach you, Naga?"\c
{BG:341100}
\e

{BLOCK:35}
I feel like I'm about to hear her voice any time now.@
She'd look at me with those unfocused eyes, with that innocent, childish smile on her face while her silky hair flutters in the wind...\c
{BGMFOUT}
{BGMWAIT}
{VISUAL:220000}
\e

{BLOCK:36}
A gush of wind blows past me and soars high in the sky.@
The shadow of a plane traversing the sky crosses the courtyard and engulfs me as I stand on the rooftop.@
After the shadow passes through, the sunlight shines upon me again.#

{BLOCK:37}
In the blue, pure blue, persian blue sky,@
amorphous clouds drift towards faraway distances.@
A cloud gets divided in two, and a half of it goes to combine with another cloud.#

{BLOCK:38}
I just keep gazing restlessly at the landscape.#

{BLOCK:39}
As time passes ever so slowly, I look up to the sky without muttering a word, and a single teardrop escapes from my eye.#
