Today, the cover of the newspaper features a strange caption about an incident.#

{BLOCK:1}
"Mass hysteria of unknown origin!"@
"Victim count nears 100 people!"#

{BLOCK:2}
The contents are as follows:#

{BLOCK:3}
Yesterday at around 11 P.M, in the S block of E district, K prefecture, a case of mass hysteria of unspecified cause arised.@
This extremely bizarre incident affected all the people living within a 800 meter radius around a local high school, and it brought cryptic mental hazards to roughly 100 people residing in the area.#

{BLOCK:4}
The state of the affected patients is all but promising; their condition ranges from light symptoms, to hallucinatory states caused by nervous disorders, to extremely severe dementia in the worst cases.@ All the patients still show no signs of recovery.@
Currently, the police is making strenuous efforts to pursue the truth behind this incident, but the details, including the origin, remain completely obscure.#

Awakened from my doze, I crawl out of the futon rubbing my sleepy eyes and turn off the alarm clock.@
Bright sunlight leaks through the window and warms up my cheeks.@
I stretch out, let out a large yawn, and get up from the bed.#

{BLOCK:7}
Today is day off.@
My head is still not all cleared up, and I'm not even sure what day of the week it is, but anyway, today I should be able to relax at home to my heart's content.#

{BLOCK:8}
I take off the T-shirt I use as pajamas and put on the same shirt as yesterday.@
Feeling the comfortable sun's rays on my back, I stand there dumbfounded and forget even to button up the shirt.@
The world itself makes me feel the arrival of spring.@
It looks like today will be a sunny day.#

{BLOCK:9}
I'm standing still, lost in thought.@
I feel like I've been dreaming.@
Like I've been seeing a long, long dream...@
I have a feeling it was probably a nightmare, but also that it was a really sweet dream.@
Despite I'm sure it was a very significant dream, for some strange reason I can't remember anything about it.#

{BLOCK:10}
Once in a while, fragments of it pop out in my mind like scenes from a movie.@
However, despite I piece them together chronologically, I'm unable to rebuild the full story.@
That proves it was a very ethereal dream.@
Thing is, every one of those scenes is packed with a stunning level of realism, or at least that's what I feel.\c

{BLOCK:11}
I leave the room with a loose appeareance and climb down the stairs.@
There's nobody in the living room.@
I wonder where my parents went.@
Hold up.@
Maybe something happened and they had to go out for that reason.@
What was it?@
Where was it?@
Well, it doesn't really matter, does it?#

{BLOCK:12}
Even though I've just woken up, I feel strangely hungry.@
I take a loaf of bread from the table, drop it in the toaster, and push the switch.@
*SHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH*@
The toaster timer goes round and round.#

{BLOCK:13}
I have way too much spare time until the toast gets done, so I turn the TV on.#

{BLOCK:14}
{FLASH}
*Push*#

{BLOCK:15}
"And the cause is still unclear.@ The police suspects this incident of mass hysteria ocurred in the prefecture K, district E, block S could have been caused by a gas leak, and at present, the authorities are doing their best to take this investigation further..."#

{BLOCK:16}
"Currently, there are already more than 140 victims with no signs of recovery, and their families are becoming more and more worried.@ In other news..."#

{BLOCK:17}
The TV screen shakes wildly.@
I stare at it for a while, astonished, and suddenly realize something critical.@
{BGMFOUT}
{BGMWAIT}
How could I forget something so important?@
I can't believe my own foolishness.#

{BLOCK:18}
I forgot to plug the toaster.#
