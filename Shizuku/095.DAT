*Click! Click!*@ I stretch the lead of my mechanical pencil again and again as I let it run meaninglessly through my notebook, until eventually, the lead breaks apart and some specks hit my cheek.#

{BLOCK:1}
The sluggish wind swaying the beige curtains makes this classroom feel even more like a scene from a silent, colorless film, completely removed from reality.#

{BLOCK:2}
Inside the classroom, lit by the afternoon sun, dead-eyed students write down rows upon rows of notes as they gulp in great lungfuls of chalk dust.#

{BLOCK:3}
And thus, the incident has quietly come to an end.#

{BLOCK:4}
Now I am the only person left who has any recollection of it.#

{BLOCK:5}
I deleted Mizuho and Shinjo's memories with my electromagnetic waves.@
Part of the reason was that I didn't want anything about the toxic waves to go public, but also because the girls don't have any reason to suffer remembering the abhorrent things they went through.@
I think that was the last time I'll ever use my electromagnetic waves.#

{BLOCK:6}
The student council girls lost their memories right after waking up since they were only mind-controlled from the start.@
Perhaps they got surprised at their amnesia after reaching home.#

{BLOCK:7}
Ohta, who returned to the hospital, was later transferred to a psych ward.@
The seemingly meaningful diary she left behind was written off as a delusion caused by her hallucinatory state.@
According to some rumors, she's beyond all hope of recovery.#

{BLOCK:8}
And as for Tsukishima and Ruriko...\c

{BLOCK:9}
That night when we embraced each other under the moonlight, I secretly emitted my electromagnetic waves for (probably) the last time.#

{BLOCK:10}
Without them noticing it, I penetrated the minds of Ruriko and Tsukishima with my waves and destroyed all the loathsome memories of their past.@
I deleted that day when Tsukishima assaulted Ruriko, their memories of the electromagnetic waves...@ and the ones about myself.@ I erased them all.#

{BLOCK:11}
They should be now the good siblings they used to be.#

{BLOCK:12}
This is merely the conclusion I reached; perhaps it'll take some time, but even though she opened the gate towards insanity, maybe Ruriko will come back to this side eventually.@
After all, compared to Ohta, her symptoms are far less serious...\c

{BLOCK:13}
An emotionless teacher reads a text in a language I don't comprehend.@>
The sound of the students running their pens across their notebooks mixes with the sound of the teacher hitting the blackboard with the chalk.#

{BLOCK:14}
Afterwards, the world has never lost its sound and color again.@
The real world is as boring as always, but strangely, I feel oddly fulfilled.#

{BLOCK:15}
I look out the window with an absent-minded face.@
All while thinking about Ruriko...\c

{BLOCK:16}
Given enough time, she should return to be the same Ruriko she once was.@
That quiet Ruriko who always reads books and who'd be perfectly described as a closeted maiden.@
That Ruriko who'd never ever give me the time of day...#

{BLOCK:17}
From beyond the beige curtains swaying gently, a soft breeze blows along with the warm sunlight.@
The sun's rays reflecting off the glass are projected on the ceiling of the classroom, drawing radiant flowers of light.@
That's beautiful...@
I had no idea the world was always such a wonderful place.\c
{VISUAL:270303}

{BLOCK:18}
In today's lunch break, I head to the rooftop where I first talked with Ruriko.@
I pass by Mizuho on my way through the hallway.@
I walk right by her side, but she ignores me and keeps talking cheerfully with her friends next to her.@
She probably doesn't remember me, much less my face.@
When I stop on my tracks, she turns around the corner and I continue to observe her from behind until she vanishes from my sight.#

{BLOCK:19}
I considered long and hard about destroying Mizuho's memories regarding Ohta.@
I know all too well how much she suffered, so I thought it'd be better for her to just forget it all at once.@
However, it seems Mizuho is a stronger girl than I thought.@
She's now smiling happily.@
Despite her heart is packed full with tears, she shows herself cheerful and courageous.@
I couldn't possibly rob her of her memories.\c

{BLOCK:20}
A pleasant breeze blows in the rooftop.@
I gaze at the urban landscape below the fence.@
Enveloped by the radiang rays of the afternoon sun, the world itself makes me feel the signs of spring approaching.#

{BLOCK:21}
A gush of wind blows past me and soars high in the sky.@
The shadow of a plane traversing the sky crosses the courtyard and engulfs me as I stand on the rooftop.@
After the shadow passes through, the sunlight shines upon me again.#

{BLOCK:22}
And then...\c
{BG:000011}
\e

{BLOCK:23}
"Did my waves reach you, Naga?"#

{BLOCK:24}
I hear that voice from behind and turn around awkwardly.@
There...\c
{VISUAL:121100}
\e

{BLOCK:25}
I'm struck with a flashback about that day.@
The day of my first encounter with Ruriko...@
Those memories awaken in my mind in full vividness.#

{BLOCK:26}
Just like that day, Ruriko is standing there with those unfocused eyes; with that innocent, childish smile on her face as her silky hair flutters in the wind...#

{BLOCK:27}
"W-Why...?"@
I open my eyes wide and fall silent.@
"You're always making that face, Naga..."@
Ruriko narrows her eyes, tilts her head, and chuckles as if the whole thing was just funny to her.#

{BLOCK:28}
"R-Ruriko...@ Do you...@ remember me?"@
I ask her, and she stops laughing.@ Now she's looking into my eyes fixedly.@
Her pupils are the same as always.@
Their focus is a bit off, like a starless sky reflected on a dark lake.@
However, my own eyes are reflected in them.@
"I'd never forget you."@
"Huh?"#

{BLOCK:29}
"You're the last person I'd ever forget.@ I mean, it's you, Naga."\c

{BLOCK:30}
In the blue, pure blue, persian blue sky,@
amorphous clouds drift towards faraway distances.@
A cloud gets divided in two, and a half of it goes to combine with another cloud.#

{BLOCK:31}
Illuminated by the pouring, bright sunlight, our shadows at our feet become one and project sharply on the floor.@
In this slow paced lapse, we embrace each other without muttering a word while feeling other's heartbeats.#

{BLOCK:32}
I try to hide it from Ruriko, but a single teardrop, illuminated by the sunlight, spills from my eye shining like a gem.#
