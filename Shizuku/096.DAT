It's been a week since I declined my uncle's request.@
Every passing day the world loses its color and sound for longer and longer time.@
The door of insanity is now within my immediate reach.#

{BLOCK:1}
According to some rumors of unknown origin, Ohta was transferred from the local general hospital to a psychatric ward.@
A certain day, when I passed by my uncle in the hallway and asked him how the investigation was going, he told me that, in the end, the seemingly meaningful diary she left behind was discarded as a sort of delusion product of the hallucinatory state she was suffering.@
Among some students, the rumor goes that she's beyond all hope of recovery.#

{BLOCK:2}
Today is the graduation ceremony of our high school, which came a bit later than other schools.@
After they're done singing the school song, both graduated and enrolled students sit in the folding chairs lined up in the hall.@
As they cycle between standing up,@ bowing,@ and sitting down@ again and again, I start to feel the world loses its sound and color once more.#

{BLOCK:3}
The long speech of the principal, the diploma awards, the farewell addresses of the enrolled students, the formal replies of the graduates...@ All of that reflects in my eyes like a monochrome, silent film.#

{BLOCK:4}
The girls wipe their tears using handkerchiefs.@
What in the world are they sad about?@ Is separating from someone really that sorrowful?@
It doesn't matter who we meet or who we say goodbye to, because in the end we humans are all alone.@
Once today's ceremony ends, my environment will only change ever so slightly, and that's all there is to it.@
However, I have a feeling this stupid world will always be a worthless piece of crap, now and forever.#

{BLOCK:5}
As long as someone doesn't put and end to it...@
As long as someone doesn't obliterate it...#

{BLOCK:6}
I'd like to take up that role.@
I'd gladly be the one to press the switch of a nuke that'd burn the world to a crisp and exterminate it.#

{BLOCK:7}
The mute ceremony keeps going...@
and these hypocrites keep pretending to cry.@
I wonder if they're aware that they're shedding tears for their own convenience.@
I begin to feel suffocated inside this room.#

{BLOCK:8}
If there was enough gunpowder here to blast them all out of existence, I wouldn't hesitate to start the fire.@
I couldn't care less about being trapped in it.@
If that's what it takes to take all these imbeciles down to hell with me, I'd be happy to oblige.@
As long as I can watch their faces distort in fear...#

{BLOCK:9}
Hot, sticky blood pumps through my whole body.@
Feeling a pleasure similar to being high, an ecstatic expression surges on my face.#

{BLOCK:10}
Die, you motherfuckers.@
Die before my persona in this world disappears...\c

*Thump*@ *Thump*@ *Thump*@
My heart starts beating really fast.#

{BLOCK:12}
It feels strange.@ The core of my body is burning, and I'm sweating through every pore of my skin.@ My brain stings, and the world itself sways like a distorted film.@
It's just as if particles of electricity ran through my head.#

{BLOCK:13}
At that moment, a boy sitting next to me starts trembling.@
It seems he's not shaking from cold.@
Just like a kid throwing an epileptic fitâ€‹, he stares up to the ceiling as his body convulses and gasps repeatedly like a goldfish out of water.#

{BLOCK:14}
Now that I notice it, he's not the only one experiencing such a seizure.@
The guy next to him, and the one next too...@ No, if I take a look around, everybody in the hall is suffering uncontrollable spasms.#

{BLOCK:15}
The world momentarily recovers its sound and color.@
It's almost as if this evident abnormality happening before me is meant to give me life energy...#

{BLOCK:16}
But, what is this, exactly...?@
*Bzzzt*@ *Bzzzt*@ As I observe the scene jaw-dropped, particles of electricity rush across my brain out of the blue.@
"!"@
What is this feeling?@
My field of vision is shaking.@
Are they all going through the same electric shock?\c
{PCMSTOP}

{BLOCK:17}
Next thing I know, the world bends as easily as if made of rubber.@>
My heart starts pounding as heavily as an alarm bell, and blood runs through my body with the force of a broken dam.@>
My brain stings.@ It feels like electricity particles are flowing across it...@>
The physical illusion of a plethora of hot elements gathering inside my body makes me break a sweat.@>
My body feels hot...@ As hot as burning flames.#

{BLOCK:18}
The students across the hall fall from their folding chairs and then stand up.@
Enrolled students, graduates, teachers, parents, siblings...#

{BLOCK:19}
The electric current rushing inside my head becomes gradually more intense.@
My whole body is numb, and I can't even move my tongue.#

{BLOCK:20}
After losing all control of my body, it starts to move on its own.@
I fall off the chair on my back, get up, and my legs begin walking independently.@
It looks like I'm not the only one moving from my place.@ Everybody in the hall stands up from their seats and walks away.#

{BLOCK:21}
And just like that, we get all mixed up.@
Boys, girls, teachers, parents...@ Everyone walks in circles meaninglessly.@
It's like that game of musical chairs where we wait for a signal to stop.#

{BLOCK:22}
The electric current running across my brain goes beyond mere biting and becomes painful.@
I'm sweating through my whole body, and nausea wells up in my throat.#

{BLOCK:23}
I'm being controlled by someone.@
I don't know why, but I'm sure about that.@
Everyone in the hall is being manipulated like remote controlled toys.@
The current rushing across my head is, undoubtedly, signals sent to my brain to issue orders.@
It's strange, but that's what I feel instinctively.#

{BLOCK:24}
Is this some kind of nightmare brought by my delusions,@
or is it reality?#

{BLOCK:25}
A girl is walking towards me.@
I don't know what her intentions are, but she undresses her uniform out of the blue, strips all her clothes down to her underwear, and draws close to me.#

{BLOCK:26}
Not only her.@
Every girl in the room starts stripping themselves naked.@
The girl before me, the one by her side, the one behind her...@ Every single one.@
Roughly 500 female students get naked and reveal their pale skin all at once.@
They all stare at a fixed point in space with corrupted eyes, just like Ohta did that day.@
Even the more than 40 female teachers on the other side and the parents around here take off their clothes by themselves and expose their weakened bodies without a trace of shame.#

{BLOCK:27}
They're crazy.@
Everybody's insane.@
This is like the witches' sabbath I read about in a book once.@
A feast of debauchery.#

{BLOCK:28}
The girl before me rips off her underwear violently, exhibits her breasts, and clings to me.@
It's a girl I've never seen before.@ I don't even know if we're in the same school year.@
As she rubs her bosom with her left hand, she join her lips with mine and inserts her tongue into my mouth forcefully.@
She unzips my trousers with her right hand and grabs my penis to take it out from inside.@
Despite we're carrying out an obviously deranged act, my body accepts it as if it was the most natural thing in the world.#

{BLOCK:29}
I slide my right hand into her underwear and touch her intimate zone, burning hot with fluids, using my fingertips.@
*Twitch!*@ Her body jerks.@
Unable to control my own body, I become a savage beast that craves pleasure.#
