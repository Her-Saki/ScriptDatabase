{BLOCK:0}
The jet-black darkness recedes little by little and my mind starts getting foggy.@>
Eventually, my ears begin ringing and the fog gradually decreases.@>
As I recover my consciousness, stings of pain bite on the wound on the back of my head everytime blood pumps through it.@>
I feel something warm mounted onto my thighs.@>
My crotch feels... nice,@>
but that doesn't change the fact that this is the worst awakening I've ever had.\c

{BLOCK:1}
What happened to me?@>
Where am I?@>
I slowly open my eyelids,@>
and the very first thing that pops up in my narrowed field of vision is a pair of white breasts.@>
They're swaying.@
The well-formed bosom bounces side to side.@>
I move my gaze to see who it is above me.#

{BLOCK:2}
It's Ohta.@>
With her usual unfocused gaze, she looks at a fixed point in space absent-mindedly.@>
As she breathes hard just like a cat in heat, her body jerks up and down.#

{BLOCK:3}
Our sexual organs are connected,@>
and my penis is sliding in and out of her vagina.@>
We're... having sex.@>
*Zub* *Zub*@>
I'm going deeper and deeper.@>
My penis sinks into her genitalia...@>
*Zub* *Zub* *Zub* *Zub*@>
and then glides out.@>
It's a thrust -> pull out cycle.#

{BLOCK:4}
In contrast to the coldness of her skin, Ohta's vaginal walls are burning hot and slimy with plenty of sexual fluids.@>
They tighten around me firmly.@>
It feels good.@>
I might just come from this alone.@>
"Ohta...@ Please stop..."@>
I say with a squeezed voice.#

{BLOCK:5}
"Hey, you up?"@>
I hear Tsukishima's friendly voice coming from somewhere.@>
He's smiling mischievously beyond Ohta.@>
"Looks like I'm having a lot of visitors tonight.@ Shinjo, Aihara, and now you.@ You came to investigate us, right?@ Congrats on the good job."@>
Tsukishima says smiling.#

{BLOCK:6}
"A-Aah!@ Y-Yuusuke!"@>
"N-No!@ P-Please save us, Nagase!"@>
When I move my gaze, I see Mizuho and Shinjo being vehemently assaulted by the student council girls.@>
They poke at their sexual organs and bite their breasts.@>
As they receive such fierce same-sex caresses, Mizuho and Shinjo might as well reach the climax at any moment.#

{BLOCK:7}
"M-Make it stop...@ That was enough..."@>
There's no doubt Tsukishima is instigating Ohta and the council girls.@>
I glare at him with a piercing stare.@>
"I think you should worry about yourself instead of them."@>
Tsukishima smiles pleasantly.@>
I grasp immediately the meaning behind his words.#

{BLOCK:8}
I can't move.@>
My body is...@ paralyzed.@>
I'm not binded by anything, yet I can't move an inch.#

{BLOCK:9}
"W-What did you do to my body?!"@>
"Nothing special.@ I didn't tie you or drug you.@ Your brain is simply not giving the order to your body to move, that's it."@>
Tsukishima chuckles maliciously.@>
Electromagnetic waves...@>
I'm sure he gnawed at my brain while I was sleeping.#

{BLOCK:10}
Still connected to me, the movements of Ohta's hips become more aggresive.@>
As she stares at a fixed point in space with an unfocused gaze, she often rocks her body back and forth on purpose to apply more weight onto the zone of our connection and twists her hips side to side with wide-ranging motions, thus skillfully luring me to an abyss of joy.@

{BLOCK:11}
Ohta squeezes my thing whose tip hits her womb.@>
Sexual fluids flow down my penis to my abdomen.@>
Making wet, lewd sounds, I keep making round trips in and out her.@>
Ohta's white breasts sway before my eyes.@>
With my rationale long gone, I suck the nipples that crown them in a trance.#

{BLOCK:12}
I've already hit my limit.@
I try to pull out, but predictably, my body doesn't obey me.@
I can't take it anymore!@
"I-It's no use!@ I'm gonna come!"#

{BLOCK:13}
I release everything I had accumulated.@>
*Splash!*@ *Splash!*@>
I ejaculate inside her vagina.@ I think this is the first time I had shot such a massive load of semen.@>
"Uh...@ Uuh..."@>
Breathing hard, I lay in the floor exhausted.@>
An overall lethargy assaults my whole body.#

{BLOCK:14}
However, Ohta never stops moving her hips.@>
She bends back and forth violently as if she wanted to drain until the very last drop of my life energy.#

{BLOCK:15}
"Good grief, should I call you "two-push-Yuusuke" from now on?@ How come you came SO quickly?@ You're supposed to satisfy the girl too, y'know?"@>
{FLASH}
In unison with his words, electric current runs through my cranium.@>
"!"@>
Are these the toxic electromagnetic waves Tsukishima mentioned?@>
Do they really pierce one's skull and infiltrate the brain?#

{BLOCK:16}
Strangely, I feel like a million of hot THINGS are gathering inside my body.@>
My skin breaks a sweat as nausea wells up in my throat.@>
An intense pain bites me and the world starts to shake.@>
At the same time, my previously tired penis grows muscular again.@>
It becomes incredibly stiff, just like a volcano about to erupt.#

{BLOCK:17}
My penis goes into a rampage inside her vagina with enough force to tear it apart.@>
Ohta's face becomes ecstatic.@>
"Aaah!@ Aaaaaah!"@>
She screams in delight just like a baby.@>
More sexual fluid drips on my abdomen.@>
I feel her vagina squeezes my tool.@>
"FUAAAAAAAAAAH!"@>
That's the proof Ohta reached an orgasm.#

{BLOCK:18}
Ohta trembles as she bends backwards, jumps up, and my penis slides out of her.@>
She lies exhaustedly as her chest moves up and down.@>
A nebula of semen drips from the small hole where we were just connected.\c
{CHABG:c42141010}
\e

{BLOCK:19}
"This is only the beginning.@ If you leave them alone, Aihara and Shinjo will feel lonely."@>
Tsukishima says with a gentle voice.@>
{CHARA:c99}
"N-No!"@>
"Please spare us!"@>
Heartbreakingly, Aihara and Shinjo beg for mercy.#

{BLOCK:20}
The pair of girls that were sexually assaulting them become angry for some reason and increase the ferociousness of their attack.@>
"Aaaaah!"@>
"Hyaaaaa!"@>
Their bodies bend backwards as they scream.\c
{BGMFOUT}
{BGMWAIT}
\e

{BLOCK:21}
I watch the tragedy unfold in my blurry field of vision,@>
and then, without even trying,@>
something important comes to my mind.@>
Ruriko...@>
I wonder what happened to her.@>
Is she safe?@>
Did she actually managed to escape...?#

{BLOCK:22}
Ruriko...@>
I want to meet her...@>
Just one more time...#

{BLOCK:23}
"Ruriko..."@>
I mutter in a low voice.\c
{CHARA:c44}
\e

{BLOCK:24}
{PCMLOAD:12}
"Huh?@ What did you just say?"@>
{BGMPLAY:21}
Tsukishima reacts sensitively to Ruriko's name.@>
Dammit!@>
I said something I shouldn't have.@>
"C'mon, repeat it."@>
"......"@>
Now that I mentioned Ruriko's name by accident, I feel like I just dug my own grave.#

{BLOCK:25}
"I told you to repeat the name you just said."@>
{FLASH}
Just like before, particles of electric current race across my head.@>
{PCMPLAY:0100}
{FLASH}
Just like a TV with poor signal, my field of vision sways side to side.@>
I see everybody double and even triple: Ohta standing before me, Mizuho lying on the floor exhaustedly, Shinjo trembling uncontrollably, and the girls of the student council.\c
{CHARA:c43}
\e

{BLOCK:26}
"What have you to do with Ruriko?!"#

{BLOCK:27}
{FLASH}
My field of vision shakes violently,
{FLASH}
\pand my ears ring.@\p\n
My mind, my spirit, my very existence gets crushed and reduced to a pulp like it was thrown in a mixer.@
{CHARA:c99}
{PCMPLAY:0100}
{FLASH}
{PCMWAIT}
{PCMFOUT}
A remarkably strong cluster of waves hits my body.@ It feels like an iron sphere the size of a volleyball ball hitting me right in the head from the rooftop of a 10 stories building.@>
The world sways 100 times more vigorously than if I was seasick.#

{BLOCK:28}
My soul is about to be tore apart.@>
I think I'm beyond salvation.@>
I leave the rest in your hands, uncle.@>
The world before me turns pitch-black.\c
{BG:000011}
\e

{BLOCK:29}
No one can stop Tsukishima anymore.@>
He'll just keep walking his path smashing all the obstacles in the way.@>
A path of insanity and destruction...@>
to which he'll drag us with him.\c

{BLOCK:30}
Ah, how I wish I could see Ruriko...#

{BLOCK:31}
That's the very last thing I think.@>
Her brittle, slender shoulders...@ Her beautiful hair...@ Her soft bosom...@>
I recall every detail burned deep into my memory.#

{BLOCK:32}
As I think about that, I feel something cold sliding along my cheek.@>
It's...@ a teardrop.@>
Without even realizing it, I find myself crying.#

{BLOCK:33}
"Goodbye, Ruriko..."@>
I couldn't check out how Tsukishima reacted to those words.#

{BLOCK:34}
Then I...@ break.#
