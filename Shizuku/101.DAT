"Fine.@ If you insist, I'll have you keep me company from tonight on."@
{CHARA:r12}
"Yay!@ That's more like it!@ I knew I could count on you!"@
Shinjo leaps in place happily.@ She's WAY too eager about this.@
"I don't know about the ghost fuss, but you bet I'm gonna yell to those scandalous jerks!"@
Shinjo mimics a punch as if hitting an invisible criminal.#

{BLOCK:1}
"Uh, I think you've gotten that part wrong."@
{CHARA:r10}
"Huh?@ What part?"@
"I'm not investigating the ghost scandal or anything of the sort."@
"Oh, really?@ What is it then?"@
I want to act as if nothing had happened.#

{BLOCK:2}
"It's too long of a story to explain out, but basically, there are weird reunions happening here at school everyday.@ That's what I'm patrolling for.@ I have to verify if it's really happening or not, who are participating, where is it taking place, etc."@
I summarize it to the best of my ability.@
"Hmm...@ Fishy reunions, huh?@ Like, they're sniffing glue or something?@ I wonder if there are guys like that nowadays."@
"Quite close, but that's not actually the case.@ I'm just gonna say that, if it becomes public, it'll cause trouble to the school."#

{BLOCK:3}
"But, what I saw last night were all girls.@ All of them looked completely normal, and they didn't give off troublemaker vibes."@
As Shinjo strolls down memory lane, she takes her chin to her hand and loses herself in thought.@
"Oh, but they certainly looked dangerous.@ Like they were... broken or something.@ Creepy stuff."@
Broken, huh?@
{CHABG:l30010505}
I react sensitively to Shinjo's words...@
and recall vividly how Ohta looked that day.\c
{CHABG:r10430505}

{BLOCK:4}
"If you told me they were doing glue, I think I'd just believe it."@
Shinjo nods in self-agreement.@
{CHARA:r12}
"Ah!"@
Shinjo screams out of the blue.@ She claps her hands as if she just realized something.@
"What if they're the ones causing the ghost scandal?"#

{BLOCK:5}
"I think that's very possible.@ Even if that wasn't their intention, that's what the witnesses saw."@
"So that means we're investigating the ghost scandal all the same.@ They're causing us trouble all the same, after all!@ How come they're scaring people on top of sniffing glue?@ They're so nasty!"@
If I don't stop her, she'll keep going off a tangent.#

{BLOCK:6}
"I'm telling you no one's sniffing glue!@ They're gathering for some other purpose!"@
{CHARA:r10}
"Oh, really?@ What purpose?"@
Shinjo stares at me with sparkling eyes.@
"W-Well..."@
"Yeah?"#

{BLOCK:7}
Their group gathers every night to have sex until dawn, using the school as a hotel...@
It's hard to talk about such a topic with a girl.@
"I-It's a bit difficult to explain it here.@ I can't just sum it up.@ Also, I'm a bit short of time right now.@ Sorry, but I have agreed to meet someone."@
I casually avert my gaze from Shinjo.#

{BLOCK:8}
"Hmm, okay, let's leave it for later.@ I'm gonna be at the club, so pay me a visit."@
"Huh?@ You want me to drop by your club?"@
"Yeah.@ I usually practice at the second gym.@ We train on our own until our advisor teacher comes, so I can go out for a little while."#

{BLOCK:9}
"Well, I don't really mind..."@
{CHARA:r13}
"It's a promise!@ When that time comes, let's keep talking about this and meet later at night!"#

{BLOCK:10}
Shinjo says flashing a wink.@
That's just her playful nature in action.@
Hmm...@
Without even realizing it, she's gotten away with what she wanted.@
I must admit I'm often a total pushover.#

{BLOCK:11}
"Anyway, see ya later, Sherlock junior!"@
{CHARA:r99}
Shinjo pats my shoulder as a sort of farewell gift and walks away through the hallway humming a song.\c

{BLOCK:12}
She's a strange girl.@
Just by looking at her my mood becomes cheerful.@
I bet even the spooky school at night will feel a little brighter with her.@
However, she's a bit unpredictable, and that makes me feel anxious.@
But, why is she so enthusiastic about cooperating in the investigation?@
I think her anger for the ghost scandal is a weak reason for it.@
I'll ask her about it more in detail later.#
