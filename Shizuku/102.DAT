After saying goodbye to Mizuho, I head to the second gym just as I agreed with Shinjo.#

{BLOCK:1}
The second gym is relatively new compared to the main building, it's well built, and it's often used to hold lectures and other school events.@
Cherry trees grow all around it in a row.@ Last night, Shinjo witnessed three suspicious girls near there.@
If we're to suppose they were the participants of the gatherings we're investigating, we can use this area as a foothold to proceed with the survey.#

{BLOCK:2}
As I approach the door of the gym, I can hear the girls yelling "fight! fight!" and the volleyballs bouncing.@
{BG:510404}
When I open the entrance door and take a peek inside, I'm overwhelmed by the sight of several volleyballs flying past each other with great momentum.@
One of the balls bounces off the floor and hits me in the chest.@
A wavy-haired girl holding a ball in both arms (probably a first-year ball picker) walks towards me chasing the other ball.#

{BLOCK:3}
"Um, excuse me."@
I talk to the girl.@
"Is something the matter?"@
"I have something to tell Shinjo."@
Without saying anything, she turns around and throws the ball to a basket inside the gym.@
"Saori!@ Someone came for you!"@, she shouts in a loud voice that echoes across the gym.@
I kinda feel a little embarrassed.#

{BLOCK:4}
Shinjo, who is training spikes with the net on the other side of the court in her sports uniform, reacts to the girl's shout and points her head in my direction with a cheerful smile.@
She performs a serve from the opposite side of the playfield which crosses over the net.@
The girl next to her receives it and in turn does a small pass.#

{BLOCK:5}
Shinjo jumps very high.@
Her long hair flutters in the air and her jacket flaps up to her belly button.@
*Slam*!@
She releases a fierce spike, and the ball hits the court of the rival team.@
I genuinely think she looks cool while training.#

{BLOCK:6}
"Rotation!"@, Shinjo shouts, and everybody shifts their positions one at a time.@
Shinjo draws apart from that circle, and heads towards me as she pushes up her hair.@

{BGMPLAY:07}
{CHARA:r18}
"Wow, you came earlier than I expected!"@
Shinjo says with a bright expression.@
"R-Really?"@
Perhaps due to the atmosphere around, she's a bit more nervous than when we talked in the hallway.#

{BLOCK:7}
"You're training like there's no tomorrow, aren't you?"@
"Really?@ We won't be this relaxed once our instructor teacher arrives, though.@ Kitazawa is very strict when it comes to club activities."@
"Heh.@ I can't quite picture that from his usual chemistry classes."@
"He was very popular at the volleball club when he was young... or at least that's what he says, but our club is strong thanks to him."@
Shinjo chuckles.#

{BLOCK:8}
At that moment, a bolt-like flying ball hits the wall right by my side and then rolls back.@
When Shinjo and I turn back, a girl is standing behind us similing mischievously.@
She throws the ball she's holding in hand to the air, and then *blam!*, smashes it against the wall once again.@
{CHARA:r19}
"Hey!@ The hell you're doing?!@ Go away with your noise!"@
Despite her complains, Shinjo's broad smile shows that she's having a lot of fun.#

{BLOCK:9}
"You're disturbing our training!@ Stop distracting us!"@
As always, the girl keeps chuckling playfully.@
Perhaps she's trying to poke fun at us...@
"Nagase, let's better talk outside before this freaky boar hits us with the ball."@
"Hey, who did just you call a boar?!"
Shinjo sticks out her tongue to the girl, giggles, holds my hand and then we leave through the door.\c

{BLOCK:10}
After leaving the gym, we walk up to the cherry trees surrounded by the dimness of the sunset.@
A slightly chilly breeze blows past our feet.@
Shinjo holds down her hair pleasantly.@
"Ah...@ The wind feels SO good!"@
Shinjo stretches her body towards the setting sun as her long hair swings in the wind.@
This looks exactly like a picture of a gravure magazine.#

{BLOCK:11}
Shinjo keeps basking delightfully under the evening sun, until eventually she turns around to face me.@ She looks at me with the mischievous eyes of a little kid.@
"Hehehehehe...@ C'mon, tell me!@ What are you actually investigating?@ I want the REAL answer."@
Flashing a wink, Shinjo cuts to the chase.#

{BLOCK:12}
"Huh?@ Oh..."@
For a moment, I'm at a loss for words.#

1. Explain her everything as it is.\n
