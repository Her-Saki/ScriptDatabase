"Shinjo!"@>
I shout out to her.@>
However, I don't get any answer.@>
No one is inside the silent gym.@>
For now, I'm just gonna look for Shinjo exhaustively.#

{BLOCK:1}
After making sure nobody is inside the gym's tool storage room, and the staff room as well, I knock the door of the girl's changing room.@>
... No reply.@>
I knock several times without response, so I try opening the door.@>
The dim room is completely empty.@>
Faint traces of moonlight leak from the small window, as well as cold air.#

{BLOCK:2}
This is odd...@>
Isn't she inside the gym anymore?#

{BLOCK:3}
I consider giving up and taking on the investigation alone, but then, I suddenly realize something.@>
Wait a minute...@>
Yeah, that's it.@ There's a changing room that regular students use for P.E class and another one for members of athletic clubs.@ The latter is built all the way in.@>
I'm gonna look up there, and if she isn't there, I'll give up.#

{BLOCK:4}
I exit through the door on the left side of the gym and walk towards the athletic club room.@>
{BG:530303}
It's a dark, windowless place.@ It doesn't feel like there's anybody here.@>
The room of the female volleyball club is here.@>
I stand before the door and knock.#

{BLOCK:5}
"Are you there, Shinjo?"@>
However, I receive no response.@>
Since the door is unlocked, I open it smoothly.\c

{BLOCK:6}
Ah!@>
Inside the gloomy room, white skin covered in moonlight catches my eye.@>
It's Shinjo... changing clothes.@>
She still didn't put on her skirt, so her underwear is exposed.#

{BLOCK:7}
"N-Nagase?!"@>
Holding her skirt with a hand, Shinjo awkwardly hides her underwear and steps back.@>
"Ah, s-sorry!"@>
My head goes blank and I suddenly don't know what to do anymore.@>
I even forget completely to close the door.#

{BLOCK:8}
Now, what will I do?\n\e

{BLOCK:9}
{XPOS:6}
{SPEED:0}
1. For now, I'll close the door.\n\e

{BLOCK:10}
{XPOS:6}
{SPEED:0}
2. For now, I'll apologize.\n\e
