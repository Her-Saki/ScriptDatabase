I don't think there's anybody inside the 2Â° gym.@
Perhaps I passed her by without noticing it...@
I decide to go back to the cherry tree spot (that is, our rendezvous) once again.\c
{BG:110303}
\e

{BLOCK:1}
However, as I expected, I don't spot any shadow resembling Shinjo under the trees.@
It's already 8:45 P.M.@
It's been 15 minutes since our agreed time.@
Perhaps she had some urgency that impeded her to come.@
Anyway, I'm just wasting my time waiting here.@
I'm gonna hang fire just a bit longer, and if she doesn't come yet, I'm gonna kick-start the survey by myself.@
The culprit gang will not just wait for us like sitting ducks, after all.#

{BLOCK:2}
After waiting for 3 more minutes, I lose my patience and I'm about to leave behind this place, but then...@
"Nagase!"@
I see Shinjo waving a hand and running towards here from the gym.#

{BLOCK:3}
{BLOCK:3}
Once she arrives to my side, she holds both of her knees out of breath as her shoulders shake up and down.@
{BGMFOUT}
{BGMWAIT}
{BGMPLAY:07}
{CHARA:r11}
"Sorry!@ Did I make you wait for too long?"@
Shinjo says peeking upwards at my face with one of her eyes closed.@
"Yeah, I've been waiting...@ for a solid 20 minutes."@
{CHARA:r10}
"No way!@ Did I really take that long?@ I thought I was only a tiny bit late."#
"It's already 8:50.@ Where the hell have you been?!"@
"The gym."@
"What?@ But I went there to look for you just a moment ago..."#

{BLOCK:4}
"Yeah, I was taking a shower but my hair kinda refused to dry.@ See?@ I have long hair so I used the dryer in the club room, but it didn't work at all.@ I thought I could still make it in time but never expected to be SO late.@ Believe me, I swear!@ I'd have realized I was late if I had some way to check out the time, but forgot my wristwatch at home today.@ That's tough luck for ya!"#

{BLOCK:5}
With her usual nonchalant mood, Shinjo keeps rattling on to no end.@
It hasn't even been 10 minutes since we met and she's already leading me by the nose.#

{BLOCK:6}
"Did the gym have a shower?@ I don't remember."@
Now that I think about it, I'm not too savvy about the gym facilities.@
"Yes, it's inside the changing room."@
The changing room of the athletics club and the one that regular students use for P.E class are in completely different locations.@
I had no way to know it was in that place.#

{BLOCK:7}
"Almost nobody uses it 'cause the main valve of the gas and stuff though.@ It's pretty annoying.@ Today I used it just because."@
"Well, if it's so rarely used, why did you have to use it TODAY of all days?"@
For crying out loud...@ If you were going to be THIS late, you shouldn't have entered at all in the first place!\c
{CHARA:r1B}
\e

{BLOCK:8}
"Hehe...@ I didn't want to be sweaty, y'know?"@, Shinjo says with upturned eyes as she fiddles with her fingers embarrassedly.@
"Huh?"@
Her long hair, still not fully dry, looks bright under the faint moonlight.@
Did she take a shower only because she was going to meet me...?#

{BLOCK:9}
"Don't go full randy just because nobody's watching your ass, you hear me?"#

{BLOCK:10}
That joke my uncle told me in the staff room drifts through my mind.@
R-Randy...@
I throw a sidelong glance at Shinjo,@
and she stares back at me fixedly.@
My heart is beating fast and my cheeks are slightly reddened.#
I feel a little... hot.
{CHARA:r10}
\e

{BLOCK:11}
"Hey, what's wrong?@ Why the silence?@ You angry or somethin'?"@
"Huh?@ Oh, n-no, not at all."@
"Really?@ Good to hear."@
Shinjo smiles cheerfully.@
"......"@
For some reason I'm strongly aware of Shinjo's feminine charm.@
It's strange.@
When I'm with her, the insanity lying within me enters a deep sleep and just never wakes up again.\c
{CHARA:r12}
\e

{BLOCK:12}
"Alright!@ Let's go patrol around the school!"@
Shinjo raises her fist to the sky and shouts a battle cry, and influenced by her, I almost let out a yell too.@
{CHARA:r13}
"Since we're gonna do this, let's make sure to catch those criminals out!"@
Shinjo exclaims flashing a wink.@
"Of course, that's the goal."@
"Good!@ Let's give it our best!"\c
{CHARA:r99}
\e

{BLOCK:13}
Once again dragged along by Shinjo's forceful mood, I decide to officially kick off the survey.#
