"U-Umm, I'm...@ changing clothes..."@, Shinjo whispers embarrassedly with her cheeks blushing red.@
I grasp immediately the meaning behind her words.@
"S-Sorry!"@
I repeat exactly what I said before and slam the door shut.\c

{BLOCK:1}
I-I saw her...@
with only her u-underwear on.@
Leaning my back against the closed door, I hear my own heart pounding heavily against my chest.@
I blink again and again with my face burning red.#

{BLOCK:2}
I'm not hearing Shinjo's voice from inside of the room at all.@
Silence has been looming for a while now.@
I wonder if Shinjo's angry...@
Yeah, of course she is.@
I just met her a couple of hours ago...@ No, even if that wasn't the case, anybody would get furious if someone saw them in underwear.#

{BLOCK:3}
Anyway, I have to apologize.@
What should I say first...?@
As I ponder about that, *clack*, the door behind me suddenly opens.@
I'm pushed forward.@
Shinjo breaks the silence first.@
Of course, she's wearing her skirt now.\c

{BLOCK:4}
"Sorry.@ You came to pick me up, didn't you?@ It looks like I took a bit too long."@
"Oh, n-not at all..."@
I reply hastily without finding the right words.@
I should apologize for peeking into the changing room and seeing her in underwear.@
However, Shinjo quickly keeps the conversation going.@
"Today's not my day.@ I forgot my wristwatch at home.@ What time is it?"#

{BLOCK:5}
"8:50 P.M...@ I think?"@
{CHARA:r11}
"Huuuh?@ It's already been 20 minutes?@ My bad!@ I just took a shower a while ago, but my hair was refusing to dry.@ See?@ I have long hair so I tried to use this dryer to dry it up, but it's sooo rusty it didn't help at all.@"
{CHARA:r10}
Shinjo is behaving as cheerfully as always, but I feel a certain awkwardness in her tone of voice.#

{BLOCK:6}
"U-Umm, Shinjo..."@
"I thought I could still make it in time but never expected to be SO late.@ Believe me, I mean it.@ If I hadn't forgotten my wristwatch, I swear I'd have made it!"@
It seems like she's trying desperately not to make me talk.@
"And on top of that, everybody went home while I was taking a shower.@ Don't you think that's cruel of them?@ Besides..."@
"Shinjo..."@
This time I cut her short.#

{BLOCK:7}
I must apologize for what I did before.#

{BLOCK:8}
"U-Umm, I'm sorry."@
"......"@
Shinjo buttons her lips all of a sudden, and then, little by little, her cheeks become red.@ As she stares at me with a huffy expression, an incredibly awkward silence takes place.@
*Thump*@ *Thump*@ My heart is beating fast.@
Eventually, Shinjo starts moving her lips slowly.\c
{CHARA:r14}

{BLOCK:9}
"You're such a perv, Nagase.@ You were staring HARD at me, weren't you?"@
"I-I wasn't, I swear I wasn't!@ I-I only took a peek!@ Now I know yours are pink, but nothing else..."@
Wah!@ Me and my big mouth!@
Shinjo's face blushes even more furiously.@
This is bad!@
I-I better change topic quickly...#

{BLOCK:10}
"B-By the way, does this gym have a shower?@ I don't really remember."@
I throw a sidelong glance at her.@
However, Shinjo keeps staring at me fixedly.@
This is awkward...@ Really, really awkward.#

{BLOCK:11}
"Sorry.@ I'm really sorry."@
This time I articulate my words in a more natural way.@
"U-Umm..."@
However, nothing other than "sorry" comes to my mind.@
However, at that moment Shinjo lets out a chuckle.@
"There is one inside the changing room."@
"Huh?"@
"Weren't we talking about the shower room?"@
Shinjo laughs as if all of this was amusing.#

{BLOCK:12}
"Almost nobody uses it, though.@ The main gas valve is broken and stuff...@ It's pretty annoying.@ Today I used it just because."@
"Oh...@ I-I see."@
{CHARA:r1B}
"Hehe...@ It's just I was sweaty and I didn't want to gross you out."@, Shinjo says looking upwards at me as she fiddles with her fingers embarrassedly.#

{BLOCK:13}
"Huh?"@
Her long hair, still not fully dry, looks bright under the faint moonlight.@
Did she take a shower just because she was going to meet me?#

{BLOCK:14}
"Don't go full randy just because nobody's watching your ass, you hear me?"#

{BLOCK:15}
The joke my uncle told me in the staff room drifts through my mind.@
R-Randy...@
I throw a sidelong glance at Shinjo...@
and she stares back at me intently.@
My heart is racing and my cheeks are slightly red.#
I feel a little... hot.#

{BLOCK:16}
"What's wrong?@ Why so silent?"@
"Huh?@ Oh, n-no, it's nothing."@
"C'mon, don't sweat it.@ I already forgot about it."@
Shinjo smiles cheerfully.@
"......"@
For some reason I'm strongly aware of Shinjo's charm.@
It's strange.@
When I'm by her side, the insanity lying within me enters a deep sleep and just never wakes up again.\c
{CHARA:r12}
\e

{BLOCK:17}
"Alright!@ Let's go patrol around the school!"@
Shinjo raises her fist to the sky and shouts a battle cry, and influenced by her, I almost let out a yell too.@
{CHARA:r13}
"Since we're gonna do this, let's make sure to catch those criminals out!"@
Shinjo exclaims flashing a wink.@
"O-Of course, that's the goal."@
"Good!@ Let's give it our best!"\c
{CHARA:r99}
\e

{BLOCK:18}
Once again dragged along by Shinjo's forceful mood, I decide to officially kick off the survey.#
