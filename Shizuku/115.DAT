We sprint through the dim hallway, run up the stairs and rush to the rooftop.@>
{CHARA:r14}
"W-Was she really there?"@>
Saori repeats the same question again and again.@>
"Yeah!@ I'm sure!"@>
My eyes didn't deceive me.@>
I'm 100% sure I saw a girl in uniform up there.\c

{BLOCK:1}
Eventually, we finish climbing up those long stairs.@>
Before us is a heavy, gray iron door.@>
This is the second time I open this door today; the first time was when I met with my uncle, and the second time is now with Saori.@>
It's unlocked.@>
I grab the knob, tilt it diagonally, and then open the door.#

In the dead of the night, chilly wind blows in from the rooftop.@>
At the same time, moonlight shines through the gap of the open door.@>
"Y-Yuusuke..."@>
Saori holds my arm wearing an anxious expression on her face.@>
What happened to her?@>
Judging by how brave she acted before, I'd have never imagined she'd be THIS scared.#

{BLOCK:4}
Now that I remember, her reaction before was a little odd too.@>
Perhaps she's actually a chicken at heart?@>
In fact, she looks like she'll sink in fear any minute now.#
