"Are you scared, Saori?"@>, I ask her whispering.@ I touch her hand as she helds my arm.@>
"S-Scared?@ N-No way!"@>
Out of the blue, Saori separates from me and takes a gutsy stance with a smile slightly stiff.@>
She looks like she's forcing herself to be brave.@>
"G-Ghosts are...@ n-nothing but bullshit..."@>
Saori whispers as she hangs her head.@>
She's actually scared out of her wits...#

{BLOCK:1}
I think I have a better grasp of Saori's fear of ghosts now.@>
It's true that part of the reason is the bad experiences she went through in middle school, but actually, her fear is instinctual rather than acquired.#
That explains her prejudice against people who enjoy paranormal stuff.@>
"Ain't no way ghosts exist."@>
She mutters to herself repeatedly.@>
I find that side of hers quite adorable.#

{BLOCK:2}
However, this is no time to ponder about that.@>
"Let's go investigate."@>
I step into the rooftop.@>
"Ah..."@>
Letting out a small gasp, Saori awkwardly rushes over to me before grabbing tight my arm once again.\c
