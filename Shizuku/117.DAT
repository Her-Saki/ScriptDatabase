"G-Ghosts?@ T-That's so ridiculous..."@, Saori mutters casting her eyes down.@>
She looks kind of pale.#

{BLOCK:1}
I think I have a better grasp of Saori's fear of ghosts now.@>
It's true that part of the reason is the bad experiences she went through in middle school, but actually, her fear is instinctual rather than acquired.#
That explains her prejudice against people who enjoy paranormal stuff.@>
"Ain't no way ghosts exist."@>
She mutters to herself repeatedly.@>

{BLOCK:2}
"Don't worry.@ I'm here to protect you."@>
I blurt out something unbelievable of me.@>
This is weird...@>
I'm not the kind of guy that says one-liners like this.#

{BLOCK:3}
I'm a coward that runs from everything.@ Someone who loathes the idea of hurting himself so much that doesn't even try to form bonds with other people.@>
Someone who hates shouldering responsibility so much that can't stand when others ask him for help.@>
That's how I am, but now, a certain sense of responsibility has begun to grow inside me.@>
That is, protecting Saori at all costs.@>
I have to account for bringing her to this investigation.#

{BLOCK:4}
But still...@ it's strange.@>
When I'm by her side, the person I was until yesterday looks to me like a remote, blurry phantom.@>
Perhaps Saori's natural cheerfullness outshines my previous, inmaterial self.@>
In her presence, that side of me that hates society with a passion without ever expressing himself or doing something about it enters a deep sleep and never wakes up.#

{BLOCK:5}
"We're not here to investigate paranormal phenomena, and even if we eventually find "ghosts" they'll turn out to be nothing more than late-night pranksters."@>
Saori lifts up her worried face and stares at me intently.@>
"You want to find them and give them a piece of your mind, don't you?"@>
Sobbing and looking scared doesn't fit Saori at all.@>
Her charm lies in her sunny, bright smile.@>
"Yeah."@>
Saori nods slowly.#

{BLOCK:6}
If she's so afraid, shouldn't we call it quits for now?@>
No, our targets won't wait for us.@>
I don't have time to lose with that.@>
"Are you ready then?@ Let's go."@>
Holding Saori's hand (she's still terrified), I step into the rooftop.\c
