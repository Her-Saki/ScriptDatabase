"Here's where I collect electromagnetic waves every day."#

{BLOCK:1}
Suddenly, I recall Ruriko's words.@>
Today at noon, after saying goodbye to my uncle in the rooftop, I met Ruriko, one of my classmates from last year.@>
I haven't seen her for a whole year, but for some reason, she changed 180 degrees from the person I used to know.@>
Her high-minded aura dilluted, and now she's like an immaculate, yet mentally immature doll with a mysterious charm surrounding her.#

{BLOCK:2}
Now that she changed so much, she mentioned strange words in our conversation.@>
Antenna...@>
Electric particles...@>
Electromagnetic waves...#

{BLOCK:3}
"You have great potential to use the power of electromagnetic waves."\c
{BG:360505}
\e

{BLOCK:4}
Now that I remember, she said I have natural talent to handle those whatchamacallit waves.@>
I still have no idea what she was talking about, but I don't think she was just pulling my leg.@>
I recall the pinky promise I exchanged with her.@>
My fingertip feels hot...#

{BLOCK:5}
That girl in uniform I saw before reminded me a bit of Ruriko.@>
Given how she is now, I feel that she'd fit perfectly with the nightly mood of that rooftop.@>
No, I'm really starting to think that human-like silhouette I saw from the hallway was actually her.@>

{BLOCK:6}
"Did you find something, Yuusuke?@ P-Please answer me..."@>
Upon hearing Saori's faint voice, I recall my original goal.@>
"Oh, sorry.@ There's nothing here."\c
{BG:330303}
\e

{BLOCK:7}
After I return to her side, Saori clings to my arm once again.@>
{CHARA:r14}
"Can we please walk away from here?@ I-I'm getting bad vibes from this place..."@>
Her voice is feeble.@>
Everybody has stuff that they just can't deal with.@>
If I hadn't brought up the topic of ghosts back there, maybe she'd have tagged along with her usual merriness.@>
"Yeah, you're right.@ Let's do that."@>
I'll be careful not to mention anything about ghosts ever again.\c
