"Haa... Haa... Haa..."@
Carrying Saori on my shoulder, I manage to run all the way up to the hallway, but exhausted, I lay her on the floor.@
She's still breathing hard.@
Her face is as red as if she just finished running a marathon, and a bit of sweat drops from her forehead.#

{BLOCK:1}
What the hell was that?!@
What was that flood of electricity running through my head?@
Was that discharge what made Saori like this?@
Did the shock drive her crazy just like it paralyzed my head?#

{BLOCK:2}
"Saori, Saori!"@
I shake Saori by the shoulders.@
...... They're slim.@
I never knew her shoulders were THIS slender.@
Saori slowly opens her eyelids and answers feebly:@
"Y-Yuusuke..."#

{BLOCK:3}
I don't know if she recognizes me, but she jumps right into my chest as if she were afraid of something.@
"T-That current...@ That electric current...@ I don't want to go through it ever again!"@
She shakes her head vigorously as her fragile shoulders quiver.@
"I'm scared, mom..."
"S-Saori..."#

{BLOCK:4}
Her cheerfulness, talkativeness, friendliness, her passion for volleyball...@
Everything about her made me thought she was a formidable girl.@
However, after seeing how afraid she is of ghosts and her current, pitiable state, I realized that it was only my own preconception.#

{BLOCK:5}
To be honest, back in the rooftop I thought it wasn't like her to be SO scared of ghosts.@
That was because I believed mistakenly she was strong-willed.@
I thought she wasn't acting like her usual self.@
I was pretty sure she was just a little scared and that she'd come back to her usual playfulness in no time.@
I convinced myself she was a strong, confident girl.#

{BLOCK:6}
However, this girl crying and trembling against my chest now is the opposite of the image I had of her.@ She's like a delicate, spoiled little child.#

{BLOCK:7}
Her shoulders are so thin they could easily break apart with just a little push.@
Her flimsy arms cling to me desperately.@
Her hair smells slightly like shampoo.@
I've finally come to realize...@
that THIS is Saori's true self.#

{BLOCK:8}
"Saori..."@
I try to call her name as gently as I can.@
"Don't worry.@ There's no current anymore."@
Languidly, Saori directs her tearful eyes towards me.@
"Yuu... Suke..."@
"I'm telling you, you won't receive another shock like that."@
"For real?"@
Saori answers with a feeble question.#

{BLOCK:9}
"What we should be doing now is moving on.@ Can you stand up?"@
"Yes."@
She nods and separates from my chest.@
She draws her knees up, lifts her hips and tries to stand up.@
However, her knees give up and she falls on her rear.@
"Yuu... suke..."@
With her bum still stuck to the floor and her knees up, she turns her sobbing gaze towards me and calls my name faintly.#

{BLOCK:10}
This may sound inappropriate, but I think she looks very cute now.@
I crouch and turn my back to her.@
"Alright, I'll carry you on my back.@ Hop on."@
"Yuusuke..."@
Saori whispers my name and braces my shoulders with both arms.@
I muster strenght and stand up, but due to excessive momentum, Saori loses balance after two or three steps.@ That's because, contrary to what I expected, she's as light as a feather.#

{BLOCK:11}
I begin walking on with Saori on my back.@
She clings firmly to my back as she shivers.@
I don't know what effect the current had on her, but I can tell she's WAY too scared.@
Perhaps Saori was always a scaredy-cat?#

{BLOCK:12}
I'm doing all what I can to restrain my fear before Saori, but just like her, I could break out quivering any moment now.@
If I became agitated now, that would only make Saori all the more anxious.@
I advance slowly, without hurry.#

{BLOCK:13}
Anyway, we have to escape to a place where nobody sees us.@
Someone might come for us from the student council room.@
I don't think those girls and Tsukishima would pose much of a threat, but I have an unshakable bad feeling about them.@
That electric current, Ohta coming out of the hospital...@ It's all so weird.@
I know I'm exaggerating, but perhaps my animal instinct warned me about a potential danger from them.#

{BLOCK:14}
For now, I'll head to the second gym where Saori left her lugagge.@
We'll hide there and rest for a while, and once Saori recovers, we'll get out from school.@
After that, I'll call my uncle, report everything I saw here to him, and forget about this incident forever.@
I don't care what happens after.@
Once I send my report, my work ends there.#

{BLOCK:15}
Anyway, running away is our priority now.@
I'm gonna head to the second gym.\c
{BG:520707}
\e

{BLOCK:16}
As always, the empty gym at night is deserted and flooded with yellow moonlight.@
Carrying Saori on my back, I cross the entrance door made of hard glass and enter the building.@
I open wide the door and set foot on the arena.@
Golden moonlight sheds light inside the gym.@
Only my wild breath echoes through the slightly dusty, chilly air.#

{BLOCK:17}
We're pretty far from the student council.@
It seems Saori's shivering has dialed down almost completely.@
However, the force she's clinging to me with has increased.@
It's like she's pushing her whole self onto me.#

{BLOCK:18}
Both of her soft breasts are pressing against my back.@
Her warm breath blows upon my nape.@
"S-Saori...@ I can't breathe."@
"Ah!@ S-Sorry..."@
With her face flushed red, she loosens her grip.@
"I-I just..."@
"It's fine, don't sweat it.\c
{BG:530707}
\e

{BLOCK:19}
However, after I give three steps forward, she presses herself against me again.@
Her plump breasts, her warm breath, her silky thighs, her soft buttocks...@
It has been only a while since I saw her in all her glory.@
That's why that lower part of myself is reacting inevitably.@
"......"@
I lean forward so that she doesn't notice my red face and my lower half.#

{BLOCK:20}
Is she so scared that she NEEDS to cling to me so badly?@
No, this actually looks more like...@
"Yuu... suke..."@
Saori embraces me stronger than ever before.@
I feel her arousing, sweet breath in my nape.@
She looks exactly like those girls of the student council we met before.#

{BLOCK:21}
"What's wrong, Saori?!"@
"Oh, sorry!@ Umm, I..."@
At that instant, she draws back immediately.@
However, after a while, she starts clinging to me again, little by little.@
She's just repeating the same actions from before.#

{BLOCK:22}
"!"@
Saori presses her pelvis against my hips.@
I feel her soft and warm abdomen thoroughly.@
"Nh...@ Fuh...@ Haa..."@
Saori lets out a painful gasp.@
"Saori!"@
When I shout her name in a slightly loud voice, she suddenly realizes what she's doing and awkwardly leans back.@
"I-It's not what you think!@ I.... I just...!"\c
{BG:270303}
\e

{BLOCK:23}
As we talk, we reach the volleyball club gym.@
I open the door, enter, and close it again with the key so that nobody comes in.@
The scent of wooden flooring drifts faintly in the air.@
Only the moonlight illuminates the gym from the window.#

{BLOCK:24}
Saori's school and sports bag remain alone on the floor, refreshingly tidied up.@
"Let's rest here."@
I sit Saori on a chair without backrest.@
When she slides down from my back, our bodies touch each other.@
"Haa!@ Nh!"@
Saori lets out an erotic moan and shrinks her body.#

{BLOCK:25}
"A-AHEM!"@
I cough.@
"......"@
Saori looks at me with dampened eyes and cheeks flushed bright red.@
She looks embarrassed, demanding, and anxious all at the same time.@ Her expression is as complex as it can get.@
What in the world is wrong with her?#

{BLOCK:26}
"Saori...@ How do you feel?"@
I crouch in order to meet her gaze directly.@
"Huh?!"@, Saori exclaims in a hoarse, loud voice.@
"Does your head hurt?"@
"N-No...@ I think I'm fine already..."@
"I see.@ That's good to hear."@
"......"@
Immediately after, she falls silent again and keeps staring at me.#

{BLOCK:27}
"You can walk on your own now, right?@ Let's go home before they find us.@ I'll carry your bags."@
I take both her school bag and her sports bag.@
"We'd better get out of here as soon as possible.@ C'mon, let's go."@
I stand before the entrance and open it with the key.@ However...@
"Saori?"@
For some reason, Saori doesn't show any will to get up.#

{BLOCK:28}
She just keeps gazing at me from the chair as she braces herself weakly.@
I notice she's quivering.@
"What is it?@ Are you still afraid?"@
Still standing in front of the door, I leave the bags on the floor and approach Saori.#

{BLOCK:29}
"N-No!"@
Saori's body stiffens up all of a sudden.@
I stop on my tracks.@
"W-What's wrong?"@
"No!@ Don't come!"@
Her cheeks furious red, Saori screams on the verge of tears.#

{BLOCK:30}
I hesitate for a bit, but finally decide to approach Saori anyway.@
We'll get nowhere like this.@
She looks a lot better than before, so we should focus on leaving the school urgently.@
"D-Don't come near me, please!"@
"What's the problem?@ I don't get it."@
Turning a deaf ear to her pleads, I keep getting closer to her.#

{BLOCK:31}
Saori's gazing at me like she's looking at something scary.@
"C'mon, let's go home."@
I try to grab her arm, but then...#

{BLOCK:32}
"No!@ Get away!"@
*THUD!*@
Saori pushes me away with both palms.@
Her thrust was forceful, but not very powerful.@ She only pushed me half a step away.@
"Saori?!"@
She looks like she's about to cry.@
"Why...?"#

{BLOCK:33}
Just then, I notice a shining liquid dripping from the zone of her butt.@
"Saori...?"@
"Ah!"@
Presuming right away that I noticed it, Saori covers her face in embarrassment and hides her crotch awkwardly pushing down her skirt.@
Instead of hiding it, that only makes it all the more evident.#

{BLOCK:34}
*Psssh*@
Along with wet sounds, several lewd, bright drops trickle down her thighs.@
"Ah!@ Aaah..."@
At first I thought she peed herself.@
However, that doesn't seem to be the case.@
That sticky, overflowing fluid is clearly not urine.#

{BLOCK:35}
It's love juice.@
The liquid that girls secrete when they're sexually aroused.@
That fluid is gleaming under the moonlight.@
As viscous love juice leaks across her thighs, Saori trembles while looking at me fixedly and braces herself.#

{BLOCK:36}
"S-Saori..."@
In an attempt to break this awkward silence, I call her name.@
*Twitch!*@
Her body twitches as she reacts surprised to my voice, and she falls from the chair.\c
{BGMFOUT}
{BGMNEXT:01}
{HSCENE:041010}
\e

{BLOCK:37}
"Eeek!"@
She lets out a short cry and falls on her rear.@ From the inside of her skirt, a different fluid from before spreads across her thighs.@
"Ah...@ Aaah...@ D-Don't look..."@
White steam rises up from the liquid.#

{BLOCK:38}
Saori bites her lip and covers her bright-red face, and then, she breaks down crying.@
This time I have no doubt...@
She peed herself.@
Unable to stand the nervousness, Saori suffered incontinence the moment she fell from the chair.#

{BLOCK:39}
Faint moonlight rays shine from the window.@
The stench of urine fills the volleyball club room packed with cold air.@
In this quiet gym at night, no one's here aside from us.@
Amidst this dim room, only Saori's quiet weeping resonates.#

{BLOCK:40}
"*Snif*@ *Snif*..."@
With her bum still on the floor, Saori covers her face as she wipes the tears dripping from her eyes.@
It wasn't my intention to scare her this much...@
No, perhaps she was holding her pee all this time.@
Maybe that's why she was acting so strangely.#

{BLOCK:41}
What should I say to her?@
"*Sob* *Sob*..."@
She keeps crying as her shoulder trembles, just like a little child.#

{BLOCK:42}
"I-I'm going out."@
I decide to leave the room for a while.@
I'll only make things more awkward if I stay here, so that will be better for Saori.@
I turn around trying not to look in Saori's direction, and walk towards the door.\c
{BG:270404}
\e

{BLOCK:43}
"W-Wait...@ Don't go."@
Saori stops me with a shaking voice.@
"I'm not going anywhere.@ I'll only stay at the other side of the door."@
"No...@ Don't leave me alone..."@
Saori says, sobbing mixed in her weeping voice.#

{BLOCK:44}
"I thought you'd have a hard time changing clothes if I'm here..."@
"I'm begging you...@ Don't go..."@
"Saori..."@
"Stay here...@ Please..."@
Saori repeats the same words again and again.#

{BLOCK:45}
"Fine, I'll stay here."@
"*Hic*@ *Hic*..."@
She looks totally like a small kid.@
"Well, I'll be facing this side, so you can change now.@ You brought your P.E uniform with you, right?"@
"*Sob*@ *Sob*..."@
All I hear from her is sobbing, and not any answer.#

{BLOCK:46}
Despite I wait for a while, Saori doesn't try to get up.@
I give her a fleeting glimpse.@
She's still stuck to the floor as tears keep dripping from her large eyes.@
"What's wrong, Saori?@ You can't change clothes?"@
I ask her with my back turned to her.#

{BLOCK:47}
"*Snif*@ *Snif*..."@
After crying for a good while, she finally holds her tears and says in a low voice:@
"*Sob*...@ I lost...@ strenght...@ in my legs..."@
"Huh?@ Y-You can't stand up?"@
"It seems I can't..."@
She explains to me, and she's about to cry once more.#

{BLOCK:48}
She can't stand up?@
Why?@
Did the fear make her legs weak?@
Or it's because that mysterious electric current from before?#

{BLOCK:49}
What should I do...?#

{BLOCK:50}
I don't know how to proceed.@ What should I do for Saori now?@
She's so pitiable that I can't leave her alone, but I can't change her myself either.@
Also, I feel it's dangerous to stay here for too long.@
And worst of all, at this rate Saori's gonna catch a cold...#

{BLOCK:51}
What do I do...?
What the hell should I do...?#
