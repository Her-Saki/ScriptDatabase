I can't help but think that those "electromagnetic waves" he mentioned have some deep connection to this case.@>
First those girls from the student council and Ohta, and now Saori...@ I think the breakdown they suffered is anything but normal.\c

"You can receive electromagnetic waves, can't you, Nagase?"#

{BLOCK:2}
I recall what Ruriko said back this afternoon.@>
Now that I remember, she mentioned the electromagnetic waves too.\c

Antenna...@>
Electric particles...@>
Electromagnetic waves...#

{BLOCK:4}
When I met her in the rooftop, a sort of electric current ran through my head.@>
Back then I thought it was only a physical illusion, but perhaps it wasn't just that.@>
That strange electric current I received before was exactly like that, but more powerful.#

{BLOCK:5}
Wasn't that current those "electromagnetic waves" she mentioned?!#

{BLOCK:6}
If that's the case, is Ruriko related to this incident as I initially suspected?@>
My speculations about the girl in the rooftop being Ruriko grow stronger.#

{BLOCK:7}
Ohta, the student council vice president...@>
The other girls from the student council...@>
Takuya Tsukishima, the former president...@>
And last but not least, Ruriko Tsukishima.#

{BLOCK:8}
--Huh?@>
"Tsukishima"?!@>
Of course!@ They share the same surname!#

{BLOCK:9}
I startle at my own dullness.@>
How could I forget something so important?!@>
Ruriko and Takuya Tsukishima are siblings.#

{BLOCK:10}
Since she was my classmate last year, I saw them going home together a lot of times.@>
I recall they were very close to each other.@>
They're indeed siblings, no doubt about it.@>
Judging by their relationship, it's no wonder they share the same oddities.@ In fact, it's the most natural thing in the world.@>

{BLOCK:11}
Electromagnetic waves, huh?@>
What exactly are they, and why are both siblings so obsessed with them?#
