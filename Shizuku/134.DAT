30 minutes have passed since then.@>
Half an hour...@>
By now, Tsukishima probably stopped searching for us.@>
It'd be most logical if he thinks we already went home.#

{BLOCK:1}
Besides, it's only a guy and three girls.@>
Not a number we cannot deal with by force if necessary.@>
Saori is recovered now, so even if we bumped into each other, it's not impossible for us to outrun them.#

{BLOCK:2}
{BGMPLAY:12}
I throw a glance at Saori.@>
Now that she's finally done changing clothes, she notices my gaze, blushes, and smiles happily and bashfully.@>
"Sorry, I'm ready."@>
Fixing her disarrayed hair, Saori walks towards me.\c
{CHARA:r1B}
\e

{BLOCK:3}
She peeks into my face from below.@>
"W-What is it?"@>
"Hehehe."@>
For some strange reason, Saori laughs embarrassedly.@>
"W-Well, let's get going now."@>
Since I have no immunity whatsoever to this kind of stuff, I avert my gaze from her and pick up the sports bag from the floor.#

{BLOCK:4}
"Geez!"@>
Saori places a hand on her hips and makes a slightly angry face.@>
"You're sooo dull!"@>
"?"@>
In the end, I never figured out what Saori's aim was.\c
{BGMNEXT:03}
{BGMFOUT}
{BG:520303}
\e

{BLOCK:5}
We leave the volleyball club room and reach the arena of the second gym.@>
The golden moonlight coming from the glass window projects pitch-black shadows at our feet.@>
I feel like the air has become way colder than before,@>
and I can't hear a single sound.#

{BLOCK:6}
I take a look around and notice there are a lot of dark spots.@>
Someone might jump at us from one of them, so I gotta be extra careful.@>
{CHARA:r14}
"Are they still there?"@>
Saori speaks nervously.#

{BLOCK:7}
"I can't say for sure, but maybe they went home already.@ I bet they think it's dangerous to stay at school any longer with us running loose."@>
I say as if reassuring myself.@>
"I hope so..."@>
Saori grabs tight the sleeve of my uniform.\c
{CHARA:r99}
\e

{BLOCK:8}
{PCMLOAD:01}
We walk along a wall of the playfield until we reach the center.@>
{PCMPLAY:0100}
{PCMWAIT}
{PCMSTOP}
{PCMFOUT}
All of a sudden, I feel a cold gust of wind stroking my cheek, and chills running down my spine.@>
And at that instant...\c
{BGMFOUT}
{BGMWAIT}
\e

{BLOCK:9}
*Creeaak*#

{BLOCK:10}
{BGMPLAY:19}
"!"@>
{CHARA:c1A}
"Heee!"@>
The two-leaf door I was heading to opens slowly with a creaky sound.@>
Beyond it, three human-shaped shadows appear.@>
Lighted by the fluorescent lamps of the emergency exit, they look like they give off an ominous green aura.#

{BLOCK:11}
"Heeee!@ N-No!@ Nooo!"@>
Saori's knees are shaking.@>
{CHARA:c99}
I give a step forward in order to cover her,@>
and then, the three shadows gradually turn around to me.@>
No doubt about it.@>
It's Ohta and the other two girls from the student council.\c
{ALLCHAR:c31l35r36}
\e

{BLOCK:12}
Both of them approach us with staggering steps.@>
They move like lifeless corpses...@ Like zombies.@>
"G-Gross!"@>
Saori clings to my back.@>
This looks straight out of a B-horror movie.@>
Heartless zombies...@>
Saori's words from a while ago flash through my mind.#

{BLOCK:13}
The moonlight lights up the trio of girls.@>
We question even more what our eyes are seeing.@>
Aside from Ohta, the other two girls are stark naked just like they were at the student council room.@>
"T-This is not normal!@ These girls are crazy!"@>
Saori's shaking on her boots.@>
Zombies without a mind of their own...@>
I wonder if they even lost their shame.\c
{REFCHAR:c99}
\e

{BLOCK:14}
"Yuusuke..."@>
Saori bends her knees as she quivers.@>
She's scared out of her wits.@>
What should I do?@>
I could escape alone, but bringing Saori along would be difficult.#

{BLOCK:15}
First off, charging ahead will be impossible.@>
I have to find another escape route.@>
Escape... route?@>
Now that I think about it, I've always been escaping from everything.@>
Unintentionally, that triviality pops up in my mind.#

{BLOCK:16}
I didn't want to get hurt, so I didn't even try to make friends.@>
I hated challenges that involved winning or losing, so I didn't compete with anyone.@>
The fear of paying the price to achieve something prevented me from making efforts towards it.@>

{BLOCK:17}
I was nothing but a breathing lump of flesh.@>
I had no reason to exist in this world.@>
I was always running away, so I felt...@>
that the world didn't need a coward like me,@>
but now...@>
Now things are different.#

{BLOCK:18}
There's at least one person who needs me: Saori.@>
I have to save her without running away.@>
I feel that, right now, that's the only reason I have left to live.#

{BLOCK:19}
The girls are less than 10 meters away from us.@>
I strengthen my resolve.@>
I have to protect Saori.@>
"I'm gonna distract them, so take the chance and escape!"@>
"Huh?!"#

{BLOCK:20}
Before Saori speaks further, I leave her there, pick up her sports bag and run towards the three girls.@>
"Uaaaaaaaaaah!"@>
"Yuusuke!"@>
I hear Saori's voice from behind.#

{BLOCK:21}
I push them aside and buy time for Saori to escape.@>
It's me against three girls.@>
Perhaps it'd be dangerous to fight them 3 VS 1, but I should be able to handle them individually.@>
To start with, I set my aim on the girl closest to me.\c
{CHARA:c35}
\e

{BLOCK:22}
{PCMLOAD:10}
I bump against her.@>
She's apparently a dainty girl.@ If I run with enough momentum, I should be able to push her away easily.@>
--Or so I thought,@>
because...!\c
{BGMSTOP}
\e

{BLOCK:23}
"!"@>
{QUAKE}
*Blam!*@>
{BG:000909}
For a moment, I didn't understand what happened.@ My body went flying and got slammed against the wall.@>
{PCMPLAY:0100}
{PCMWAIT}
{PCMSTOP}
{PCMFOUT}
{BG:520000}
The scene I was witnessing just a moment ago becomes distant.@>
I feel the pain running up my back and finally understand.@>
I was the one who got pushed.#

{BLOCK:24}
"Yuu...@ --ke...@ hang...@ --ere..."@>
Saori calls my name and screams something after.@>
My ears ring and I can't hear her well.@>
My head is dizzy.\c
{BGMPLAY:19}
\e

{BLOCK:25}
Was I thrown?@>
A grown-ass guy like me...?@>
By that petite girl...?#

{BLOCK:26}
I don't quite get what happened, but anyway, it's a fact that these girls before me possess strenght way beyond the average human.@>
I can't take them head on.@>
A single touch was enough to make me realize the overwhelming gap between our power.#

{BLOCK:27}
The three girls slowly turn back to me.@>
Everyone has the same eyes.@>
Eyes akin to a dark, grubby, muddy swamp.@>
The same eyes Ohta has.@>
The eyes of a person whose spirit broke down.#

{BLOCK:28}
The three of them approach me little by little.@>
I'm not exaggerating; I really feel like they'll kill me if I get caught.@>
This feels just like a zombie movie.@>
I stand up with great difficulty.@>
They're almost at our backs.@>
Ohta reaches out her arm to grab mine.@>
I dodge her and move to a side along the wall.\c
{CHARA:c36}
\e

{BLOCK:29}
{PCMLOAD:10}
The naked short-haired girl stands there.@>
*Swing!*@>
Her fist flies towards my face.@>
"Waah!"@>
{BG2:520910}
It was so unexpected my feet slip up and I fall to the floor.@>
{PCMPLAY:0100}
{PCMWAIT}
{PCMSTOP}
{PCMFOUT}
That was a stroke of luck.@>
The girl's fist grazed my cheek and impacted on the white concrete wall.@>
*Pow!*#

{BLOCK:30}
Along with several fragments of debris, a lukewarm liquid pours over my head.@>
"!"@>
When I look up, I see the girl's fist plunged into the wall.@>
It's truly an unbelievable scene.@>
The debris came from the concrete wall.@>
*Plip*@ *Plip*@>
And as a follow-up of those scraps, bright red liquid drizzles along with them.\c
{CHARA:L69}
\e

{BLOCK:31}
When she pulls out her fist from the wall, a good amount of that liquid rains over my face.@>
It's a lukewarm, crimson liquid...@ In other words, blood.@>
"Heee!"@>
I unintentionally gulp saliva.@>
The girl's fist is completely broken; it has been turned into a bloody lump of flesh with white bones sticking out of it.@>
Deep-colored vermillion blood scatters from it.@>

{BLOCK:32}
It seems she doesn't even feel any pain.@>
{REFCHAR:c36}
The girl lifts up her arm covered in blood.@>
Her first is able to pierce a concrete wall.@>
I imagine it would have broken my head like a watermelon in that watermelon-splitting game if it landed, scattering vivid red blood in the process.#

{BLOCK:33}
"U-Uaaah!@ Uaaaaaaaaaaah!"@>
{CHARA:c99}
I crawl on all fours while screaming and flee from this place.@>
*Swing!*@>
I hear a fist splitting the air, and next, a bloody rain pouring down.@>
"Uaaaaaaaaaaaaah!"#

{BLOCK:34}
I barely manage to stand up.@>
However, distracted by the girl behind me, I didn't notice the other girl approaching me front the front.@>
*Bam!*@>
I bump against her small breasts and lift up my face.@>
{CHARA:c35}
The long-haired girl looks down on me with an empty stare.#

{BLOCK:35}
The girl crosses her arms and tries to get a hold of me.@>
"Waaaah!"@>
{BG2:520910}
I fall on my rear on the ground and dodge it by a hair's breadth.@>
Now the short-haired girl chases me from behind.@>
I roll on the ground and slip past them; using well that momentum, I try to stand up.#

{BLOCK:36}
{PCMLOAD:10}
However, the next instant, my soles slip with the blood and my legs stagger.@>
*Slam!*@>
{BG2:520910}
{PCMPLAY:0100}
{PCMWAIT}
{PCMSTOP}
{PCMFOUT}
My balance crumbles and I fall on my face to the gym's floor.@>
I didn't even have time to experience pain.@>
Almost on the verge of tears, I try to stand up and lift up my face.#

{BLOCK:37}
*Heee!*@>
The bare feet of a girl lie before me.@>
When I look up...@ Ohta is there.\c
{CHARA:c31}
{BGMFOUT}
{BGMWAIT}
\e

{BLOCK:38}
With wobbly movements, Ohta grabs me by the shoulders and makes me stand up by force,@>
{CHARA:c99}
then she performs a full nelson on me.@>
{CHARA:l35}
The other two girls slowly approach me.@>
{CHARA:r36}
T-This has to be nightmare.@>
Yeah, there's no other explanation.@>
Like drops of ice, cold sweat slides down my spine.#

{BLOCK:39}
Ohta strangles my arms.@>
--It hurts.@>
I can almost hear the sound of my bones cracking.@>
*Drip*@ *Drip*@ As a pool forms on the floor, the girl with her right hand covered in crimson, bright blood approaches me.@>
I'm gonna be killed.@>
There's no doubt about it.@>
I'm going to be assassinated.#

{BLOCK:40}
--Will I be murdered...@>
by these girls before me?@>
--Why?@>
What did I do to deserve this?@>
I just don't get it.@>
There's no reason for me to die...\c
{BGMPLAY:01}
\e

{BLOCK:41}
--Reason?@>
You don't need a reason to kill a guy you can't tell if it's alive or dead.@>
Everybody like that should just die!@>
That's a belief I have always upheld.#

{BLOCK:42}
In that case, I must die before anybody else.@>
--That's right.@>
In a strange way, I accept my own truth and relax my whole body.#

{BLOCK:43}
The short-haired girl before me slowly lifts up her right hand covered in blood.@>
The next instant, my face will be crushed to a pulp like a watermelon in a watermelon-splitting game and a lot of bright crimson blood will scatter on the ground.@>
The next instant, I'll be already...\c
{BGMFOUT}
{BGMWAIT}
\e

{BLOCK:44}
The girl lets her right hand fall with an air-splitting sound.@>

{BLOCK:45}
A geyser of emotions surge up inside me.@>
Fear.@>
No!@>
I don't wanna die!\c
{BG2:520910}
\e

{BLOCK:46}
I kick the floor immediately and jump backwards while Ohta is still holding me.@>
I mustered a strength unbelievable of me.@>
*Swing*!@>
The girl's right hand slices down the air.@>
Drops of blood scatter and wet my cheeks.@>
Then...\c
{BGMPLAY:20}
\e

{BLOCK:47}
"Yuusuke!"@>
As soon as I hear Saori scream my name, I hear a bouncing sound and then a white object flies with amazing momentum towards here.@>
It's a volleyball.\c
{BGMNEXT:20}
{VISUAL:081010}
\e

{BLOCK:48}
{QUAKE}
*Thud!*@>
The volleyball hits the girl in front of me dead-on.@>
Caught by surprise, she loses her balance and is about to trip.\c
{BG:521010}
\e

{BLOCK:49}
{PCMLOAD:10}
It's do or die!@>
Now that Ohta let her guard down, I shake off her arms and push the girl before me with all my might.@>
{QUAKE}
*Whomp!*@>
No matter how monstrous their strenght is, they're nothing but ordinary girls before sneak attacks.@>
{PCMPLAY:0100}
{PCMWAIT}
{PCMFOUT}
{PCMSTOP}
That girl was a lightweight, so when I pushed her strongly against the wall she collapsed to the floor.#

{BLOCK:50}
"Take this!"@>
Along with that yell, Saori tosses two, three balls more.@　
{QUAKE}
*Toss!*@>
{QUAKE}
*Toss!*@>
Saorin keeps shooting spikes one after another; she's taking them from the cage she probably drew from the utilities room.#

{BLOCK:51}
Despite they're far from being lethal, Saori's spikes are powerful and good enough to scare away the girls.@>
Now that they're distracted by the balls, they're full of openings.@>
"Uaaaaaaaaaah!"@>
I take that opportunity to run past the girls through a side.#

{BLOCK:52}
"Yuusuke, this way!@ It's now or never!"@, Saori shouts.@>
I advance guided by her voice.@>
"We can leave through the window of the utilities room!"@>
Saori shoots her last spike.@>
{QUAKE}
*Blam!*@>
The ball hits Ohta in the chest and flies away high in the air.#

{BLOCK:53}
Perhaps it was Saori's doing, but the door of the utilities room before us is open.@>
We flip over the volleyball cage and scatter the balls inside.@ They go away rolling on the utilities room.@>
{BG:260202}
I close immediately the sliding door, but I don't find anything resembling a lock inside.#

{BLOCK:54}
{PCMLOAD:10}
"This way, Yuusuke!"@>
{CHABG:L6A161010}
Saori beckons to me.@>
She said we can escape through the window.@>
After opening the glass window, she uses the leveled platform of gym class to help herself enter that opening and goes outside.@>
"Ah!"@>
The hem of her skirt gets stuck on the window frame.@>
"W-What do I do?@ Ugh, I'm sick of this!"@>
Saori stops caring and just jumps outside.@>
{PCMPLAY:0100}
{PCMWAIT}
{PCMSTOP}
Her skirt teared off a little, but we can't afford to worry about that.#

{BLOCK:55}
"Yuusuke!@ Quick!"@>
Saori gets down outside and hurries me up.@>
I jump to the same leveled ground as her.@>
*Clack!*@>
Then we hear the door being opened.@>
A freezing wind blows and the three girls slowly enter the utilities room.#

{BLOCK:56}
They immediately get to us.@>
They reach out their pale hands in order to grab my ankle.@>
At the same time, I escape from the window.@>
Their hands catch the air instead.@>
By a hair's breath, I roll out towards the courtyard under the bright moonlight.\c
{PCMPLAY:01Pw}
{PCMSTOP}
{PCMFOUT}
{BG:001111}
\e

{BLOCK:57}
Saori runs over to me.@>
"Are you alright, Yuusuke?!"
I stand up, and a sting of pain bites my ankle.@>
It seems it twisted when I was rolling on the floor.@>
I turn around; the three girls are observing us absent-mindedly from the utilities room.#

{BLOCK:58}
"I-I'm fine, don't worry about me!@ Let's go!"@>
"Okay!"@>
Ignoring the pain in my ankle, I take Saori's hand and escape through the door.\c
{BGMFOUT}
{BGMWAIT}
{BG:201110}
\e

{BLOCK:59}
The moon looks as bright as if it was the sun at midday.\c
The gates are before our very eyes.@>
Those gates we're so used to see...@>
mean for us the end of this long, painful nightmare.#
