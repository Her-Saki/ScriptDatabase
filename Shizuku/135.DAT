{BLOCK:0}
"Oof...@ Oof...@ I think we'll be able to make it..."@, Saori says out of breath.@>
We're very close to the gates.@>
Once we cross it, we can say goodbye to this nightmare and return to our peaceful daily lives.#

{BLOCK:1}
That boring, dull, tiresome, trashy routine that almost drove me insane and that I hated so much feels now very nostalgic and warm to me.#

{BLOCK:2}
However, a black shadow next to the gates blows our relief away.@>
When we're just meters away from leaving this nightmarish school....\c
{BGMPLAY:19}
{CHARA:c42}
\e

{BLOCK:3}
"Where are you going?"@>
Unexpectedly, we hear a voice coming from the darkness and a black shadow stands in front of us.@>
"Ah..."@>
Saori's face contorts with fear; she's  petrified.@>
It's Tsukishima.#

{BLOCK:4}
"You're not going home in one piece after watching that."@, Tsukishima says throwing an icy glance at us.@>
I give a step forward to cover Saori.@>
"Move!"@, I say bluntly, or rather, I'm unable to say anything longer.@>
After all, I'm trembling pathetically.#

{BLOCK:5}
I don't know why, but the next instant Tsukishima starts chuckling pleasantly.@>
"Did I look like a villian to you?@ I tried to act as if this was a typical scene from a TV show..."@>
Despite that out-of-character dialogue, I don't feel any safer; Tsukishima's relaxed sneer makes me feel an indescribable fear.#

{BLOCK:6}
I feel my whole body tensing up.@>
I'm ready to jump at him as soon as he does the slightest fishy move.@>
That said, Tsukishima has good physical abilities, and I heard he performs well at sports.@>
If we get into a fist-fight, I have little chance of winning.@>
Even so, if I clash against him, I can buy time for Saori to escape.#

{BLOCK:7}
No, perhaps...@>
Some nasty thoughts assault my mind and send chills up my spine.@>
If Tsukishima possess the same inhuman strenght as the other girls...#

{BLOCK:8}
No, forget about that!@>
If I stop to think about the worst-case scenario I won't get anywhere.@>
I'll think only when I have to.@>
I must focus on crossing over this place.@>
If I waste time, that trio of monsters will come here.@>
If that happens, perhaps I won't even be able to allow Saori escape.#

{BLOCK:9}
"I said move!"@>
"Nah, don't feel like it."@>
Tsukishima smiles maliciously.@>
He's enjoying making fun of me.@>
"Move, goddammit!"@>
"No, I won't move.@ Also, you guys won't walk out these gates."@>
Tsukishima giggles like a kid.#

{BLOCK:10}
{PCMLOAD:10}
I can't afford to stamp my feet in frustration.@>
I have to do it!@ It's do or die!@>
"MOVEEE!"@>
I run with all my might and jump at Tsukishima head to head.@>
{BGMSTOP}
{BG:000909}
{QUAKE}
Taken by surprise, Tsukishima receives my punch and staggers.@>
{PCMPLAY:0100}
{PCMWAIT}
{PCMSTOP}
{PCMFOUT}
Without a moment's delay I grab the lapels of his sweatshirt and push him down to the ground.@>
"Kgh!"@>
Tsukishima groans in a low voice.#

{BLOCK:11}
I let my punch fall on Tsukishima's face with all its weight.@>

{QUAKE}
*Bam!*
{QUAKE}
*Pow*@>
{QUAKE}
*Blam!*@>
My fist hurts.@>
However, Tsukishima must be hurting a lot more.@>
I strike his bony cheek repeatedly.#

{BLOCK:12}
Despite my flurry of punches, Tsukishima keeps showing himself relaxed.@>
That looks extremely creepy to me.@>
"A-Are you satisfied now?"@, Tsukishima says.@>
"What?!"@>
I lift my fist high and drop it with all the weight of my body behind.\c
{BGMPLAY:19}
{BG:201010}
\e

{BLOCK:13}
Then...@>
{FLASH}
A huge amount of electric particles run across my head.@>
"Uagh!"@>
The electric waves of before pierce my skull and run wild in my brain.@>
My fist falling down comes to a stop right before hitting Tsukishima in the face.#

{BLOCK:14}
Strangely, I feel like a lot of hot THINGS gather inside my body.@>
My head goes numb.@>
My skin breaks a sweat and nausea wells up in my throat.@>
A sting of pain runs through my body and my field of vision shakes.#

{BLOCK:15}
The world itself bends like a rubberband.@>
"EEEEEEEEEEEEEK!@ NOOOOOOOOOOOOO...!"@>
I hear Saori's screams as she convulses uncontrollably as if they came from very, very far away.@>
I feel sick.@>
I want to puke right now.#

{BLOCK:16}
My whole body feels numb and unbereable pain bites every part of it.@>
I feel my back burning and my abdomen freezing.@ My soles tickle and several tastes run across my tongue.@>
The world is painted with psychedelic colors like red and yellow.#

{BLOCK:17}
I feel like my brain has been thrown and disintegrated in a mixer.@>
I'm shedding tears.@>
Eventually, my consciousness gives in to all that pain and sinks into darkness.\c
{BGMFOUT}
{BGMWAIT}
{BGMPLAY:01}
\e

{BLOCK:18}
There, I see a strange hallucination.#

{BLOCK:19}
It's dark, very dark abyss.@>
Inside this abyss, Saori stands in a T-pose whimpering.@>
She's not doing anything else; she's just there crying a river of tears.#

{BLOCK:20}
At some point, the surface of Saori's body starts foaming and, now that her body parts became fragile, it falls apart piece by piece.@>
Her fingers come off, her wrists fall down, and her elbows, shoulders and head roll away.@ Her limbs and waist also fall, then her thighs and knees, until only her ankles remain.#

{BLOCK:21}
Her fallen body parts wriggle like living creatures and approach me little by little.@>
Her severed head rolls around while crying to no end.@>
"It hurts...@ Save me...@ Build me up again..."#

{BLOCK:22}
As she asked me, I try and pick up her body parts.@>
However, when I touch one of them, they come apart like sand.@>
I fall on my knees and try to collect them while crying, but they slip through my fingers.#

{BLOCK:23}
"It hurts...@ Rescue me..."@>
Saori's crying voice echoes in the dark abyss endlessly.#

{BLOCK:24}
The darkness slowly fades out.@>
{BGMNEXT:21}
{BGMFOUT}
{BG:200000}
My field of vision recovers and, a bit later, my sense of taste as well.@>
I hear my own wild breathing first and then Saori's weeping.#

{BLOCK:25}
I sluggishly lift up my head.@>
{CHARA:c46}
Tsukishima is in front of me.@ He's crouching and looking down on me with an arrogant expression on his face.@>
My field of vision blurries out due to the tears accumulated in my eyes.@>
"It seems I don't need to send any more waves.@ You already became my puppets through and through."@>
Tsukishima swiftly says such nonsense.\c
{CHARA:c42}
\e

{BLOCK:26}
"What I sent to you right now are toxic waves.@ Ever heard of 'em?"@, Tsukishima asks suddenly peeking at my face.@>
"T-Toxic waves...?"@>
"Yes, toxic waves.@ They literally poisonous electromagnetic waves that pour down from the sky and drive people crazy and make them act in bizarre ways.@ They're invisible to the eye and penetrate our brains without us knowing.@ There's no way to block them."#

{BLOCK:27}
I try to stand up, but for some reason my whole body is numb and I can't move.@>
"It's useless.@ I told you; you're now a puppet under my control.@ You can't move your body freely unless I command you to do so."@>
Tsukishima smiles amusedly and leans over me.#

{BLOCK:28}
"By nature, human thoughts and feelings are basically an array of electric signals, aren't they?@ What the toxic electromagnetic waves do is distorting and polluting them with its superior power.@ Don't you find them fascinating?@ They can manipulate a person from outside..."#
Tsukishima quickly stands up.#

{BLOCK:29}
"But, what if someone could actually manipulate those toxic waves themselves?@ Don't you think it'd be a wonderful superpower?@ That means said person would be able to control other people's brains directly, as if using a remote control..."#
Staring at us directly from above, Tsukishima smiles all the more entertained.@>
"It was just a coincidence, but..."#

{BLOCK:30}
Tsukishima's eyes open wide.@>
"I happen to have that power.@ This is a worn-out term, but I'd be what is typically known as "ESP"."@>
Tsukishima opens his arms and cracks up a full blown smile.#

{BLOCK:31}
"Who'd believe... such crap...?"@>
{CHARA:c44}
"What did you just say?"@>
I almost spit my words and Tsukishima glares at me furrowing his brow.@>
"We're not... in a fucking... manga...@ There's no way a human can do that..."@>
I move my shaking lips and finally finish my sentence.#

{BLOCK:32}
However, it's an undeniable fact that I can't move my body, so I don't think Tsukishima is joking.@>
I just made fun of Tsukishima's explanation because I'm scared.@>
If I admit it's real not only my body, but my mind will collapse out of fear too.\c
{CHARA:c42}
\e

{BLOCK:33}
{PCMLOAD:12}
"Your body has been paralyzed and you still don't believe me?"@>
"Believe you?@ That's too far-fetched to be real..."@>
"Okay, I'll make you believe then.@ By force."@>
{CHARA:c99}
"What...?"#

{BLOCK:34}
{PCMPLAY:0100}
{FLASH}
{PCMWAIT}
{PCMSTOP}
{PCMFOUT}
I hear a dull sound, and then feel a huge current running through my head.@>
"Kgh...@ Kgah!"@>
Are these electromagnetic waves?!@>
Are these Tsukishima's toxic waves?!@>
Poisonous waves that override people's brains and that let their user manipulate others at will...@>
Are those being sent to my brain right now?#

{BLOCK:35}
Does that mean my toughts are being warped and that I've been transformed into Tsukishima's puppet?@>
No...@ I can't accept that.@>
I am my own person!@>
I try desperately to resist against the current.@>
However, the toxic waves weren't actually being shot at me.#

{BLOCK:36}
"Heeeaah!@ Fguuuuuuuuuuh!"@>
Right behind me, Saori screams in pain and her torso arches.@>
"Ah...@ Aah...@ Aaah...@ Aaaaaaaah..."@>
Saori's body is rock-stiff and she's shedding a river of tears.@>
The electromagnetic waves weren't fired at me, but at Saori.@>
I was just suffering the lingering aftermath of them.#

{BLOCK:37}
"I'll show you just how loyal puppets can become.@ C'mon, get up."@, Tsukishima orders with an emotionless, cold voice.@>
After convulsing two, three times, Saori stands up from the ground just as Tsukishima commanded her.@>
"N-No...@ My body...@ My body is moving on its own..."@>
Saori's voice shakes with fear.#

{BLOCK:38}
"C'mon, come here."@>
Tsukishima beckons to her smiling.@>
"No!@ Stop!@ I don't wanna go!"@>
Saori shakes her head as she cries.@>
However, her body obeys Tsukishima and walks towards him against her own will.@>
Saori stops right before him.#

{BLOCK:39}
"Good girl."@>
Tsukishima slowly reaches out his arm.@>
"Heee!"@>
Shedding large tears, Saori's body frozens.@>
"You have a nice expression on your face."@>
Tsukishima strokes her cheek.@>
Saori's knees shake out of fear.#

{BLOCK:40}
"You'll now witness how much obedience my electromagnetic waves exert over people."@>
Tsukishima looks at me and smiles cheerfully.@>
His face under the faint moonlight looks as pale as a corpse.#

{BLOCK:41}
Tsukishima takes something shiny out of his back pocket.@>
It's a pair of silvery-shining scissors.@>
The steel reflects off yellow moonlight which gives off a sharp glare.@>
"Heee!"@>
As soon as she sees them, Saori's face freezes.@>
Blade in hand, Tsukishima gives it to Saori.#

{BLOCK:42}
"Kill yourself with this to prove it."@, Tsukishima says with an unfeeling expression akin to a lifeless doll.#

{BLOCK:43}
"No... No..."@>
As she trembles, Saori's eyes overflow with large tears.@>
Her shaking hands slowly reach out to Tsukishima's hand holding out the knife.@>
From an outsider's perspective, Saori looks totally like she's moving out of her own will.@>
However, it's very clear she's not doing it of her own volition.#

{BLOCK:44}
"Ah...@ Aah...@ M-My body...@ is moving by itself..."@>
Saori grabs the silver scissors by the center and directs their sharp blade towards her.@>
"Pierce your throat and die."@, Tsukishima says smiling cheerfully.@>
"N-No...@ T-This can't be happening..."@>
The tip of the gray scissors gradually approach Saori's throat.#

{BLOCK:45}
"M-Make it stop...@ I...@ don't wanna die..."@>
Saori's hands shake as she holds the scissors.@>
"Don't!@ Stop this!"@>
Forget about rescuing her; I can't even move my body.@ Only my voice echoes miserably in the surroundings.#

{BLOCK:46}
"Y-Yuusuke...@ Help me..."@>
The tip of the sharp scissors graze Saori's throat.@>
"A-Am I going to die like this..."@>
"Saori!"#

{BLOCK:47}
"I... don't wanna..."@>
"Saori!@ Saori!"@>
"I...@ I wanna...@ I wanna go home..."@>
"SAORIII!"#

{BLOCK:48}
"C'mon, stab the scissors in your throat."@>
Tsukishima carves those words mercilessly.\c
