{BLOCKLEN:57}

{BLOCK:0}
Giving off the dull radiance of steel, the tip of the blade gets closer to Saori's throat.@>
"Ah, aah, aaah..."@>
Shaking with fear, Saori opens wide her eyes, akin to a pair of marbles, and stares at the metal.@>
Her knees are shaking.@>
Her body is acting out of her own will and is about to end her own life.@>
I wonder if there's really something scarier than that.#

{BLOCK:1}
"Saori!"@>
If possible, I'd like to run over to her right now and slap those scissors off her trembling hands.@>
I'd like to relieve that fear-stricken face and tell her it'll be alright as I embrace her tight by her slender shoulders.@>
--However,@>
I can not do that.#

{BLOCK:2}
The girl I love is about to be killed.@>
Such is the scene developing before my very eyes, yet I'm unable to move an inch.@>
I've never cursed my own powerlessness so hard before in my life.@>
"Saori!@ Saori!@ Goddammit!"@>
My scream echoes pitifully in the surroundings.#
"SAORIIIIIIIIIIIII!"#

{BLOCK:3}
But then...@>
{FLASH}
{QUAKE}
*Flash!*@>
I hear a high-pitched sound, as if something cut across the darkness of the night, and next thing I know my body feels as light as a feather.#

{BLOCK:4}
When I look up, I see a girl in school uniform standing there.@>
{BGMPLAY:08}
{CHARA:c00}
The cold wind blows towards the main building and makes the girl's hair flutter as it shines under the moonlight.@>
"Naga..."@>
She calls my name.@>
"Ruriko...?"@>
I call her name in return.\c
{CHARA:c47}
\e

{BLOCK:5}
"R-Ruriko..."@>
The most surprised of us by Ruriko's sudden appearance is Tsukishima.@>
He opens wide his eyes and stares at her with a frozen expression.@>
"Why...@ are you here...?"@>
His voice is shaking.@>
Tsukishima and Ruriko, the siblings, are now in front of each other.\c
{CHARA:c99}
\e

{BLOCK:6}
Tsukishima was always composed, but now he looks restless.@>
Ruriko stares fixedly at him.@>
{CHARA:c47}
"R-Ruriko...@ P-Please forgive me..."@>
For some reason, Tsukishima apologizes out of the blue as if he feared something.\c
{CHARA:c99}
\e

{BLOCK:7}
At the same time, Saori's hands stop and she falls to the floor like a puppet whose strings had been cut.@>
It seems Tsukishima's waves have come to a halt.@>
The strange paralysis I was suffering vanished as well.@>
"Saori!"@>
I immediately stand up, run over to her and embrace her.#

{BLOCK:8}
Ruriko follows me with her eyes.@>
Tsukishima follows Ruriko's gaze and points his eyes at us.@>
And then both of them stand face to face.@>
"T-This is not what you think, Ruriko.@ This is..."@>
Tsukishima is heavily upset; that much is clear.@>
"R-Ruriko...@ I-I..."@>
Tsukishima is quivering; he falls on his knees to the floor.#

{BLOCK:9}
"I-I didn't want...@ to do that..."@, Tsukishima mumbles.@ He holds his head with both hands and cowers on the floor.@>
And then, he trembles like a little, fragile animal.@>
"R-R-R-Ruriko...@ P-Please save me...@ I-I-I-I..."@>
Ruriko stands quietly as she observes him.@>
Her eyes are full of sadness.#

{BLOCK:10}
Ruriko looks at me.@>
Her unfocused eyes are slightly closed.@>
Eventually, she slowly reaches out her arm and points to the gates.@>
"Go, Naga."@>
She speaks in the same monotonous tone she used back when we met in the rooftop.#

{BLOCK:11}
"Yuusuke..."@>
Saori clings to me while trembling in my arms.@>
"Yuusuke, Yuusuke, Yuusuke!"@>
She presses her face against my chest and breaks out crying.@>
She looks to me as fragile as a little kid.@>
I gently stroke her pale, cold cheek.\
{BG:110909}
\e

{BLOCK:12}
At that moment, three shadows appear from the entrance of the second gym.@>
It's the trio of girls.@>
Damn.@>
We have to scram as soon as possible.\c
{BG:200909}
\e

{BLOCK:13}
"What will you do, Ruriko?"@, I ask, and then Ruriko slowly shakes her head.@>
"Ruriko..."@>
Ruriko approaches Tsukishima cowering and trembling on the floor and softly pats his back.@>
Then she gazes intently at me.@>
Her slightly narrowed eyes are telling me to forget about them and leave.#

{BLOCK:14}
"Okay..."@>
I don't say anything else.@>
I drop my gaze to the floor in order to avert Ruriko's eyes and help Saori stand up holding her by the shoulders.@ She's still trembling.@>
"Let's go, Saori."@>
"Y-Yuusuke...@ Yuusuke..."@>
Saori sobs convulsely and keeps calling my name.#

{BLOCK:15}
"It's over...@ Let's go home already."@>
I embrace Saori and gently stroke her hair.@>
"--Okay."@>
She wipes her eyes and nods.#

{BLOCK:16}
--And so we leave school.@>
When we're far from there, I throw a last fleeting glance at Ruriko.@>
She embraces Tsukishima, who is choking up with tears, and gently pats his head.@>
While expressionless as always, she looks to me like she's crying inside.\c
{BG:000011}
{BGMFOUT}
\e

{BLOCK:17}
We say goodbye to this long nightmare and return to our meaningless reality once again.@>
Like a painting, yellow moonlight shines faintly upon the world.@>
A chilly breeze strokes our cheeks as we tremble.#

{BLOCK:18}
The world of madness is closely tied with death.@>
It now looks like a distant pipe dream to me.@>
Everything becomes an ambiguous memory of the past.@>
"Yuusuke..."@>
Saori brings herself close to me.@>
Since she's still anxious, I embrace her by the shoulders.@>
Then, she lets out a sigh of relief.#

{BLOCK:19}
I hate that tiresome, dull, deadly boring, mind-blowingly stupid, puke-inducing daily life with every fiber of my being.#
However, there I can enjoy true peace.#
Yeah...@ That's right.@>
I was always surrounded by this warm peace.@>
That's exactly why I lost sight of it.@>
Of this world's gentleness, warmth...@>
Perhaps I was just being an immature edgy kid rebelling against this peaceful, secure world.#

{BLOCK:20}
In my mind, I hear the sound of my almost-open door of insanity slowly closing up.@>

{BLOCK:21}
{BGMPLAY:24}
*Ding-Dong-Ding-Dong!*\c
{BGMNEXT:03}
{BGMFOUT}
{BG:061101}
\e

{BLOCK:22}
The last class of the day ends and the classroom becomes boisterous.@>
Still on my seat, I gaze outside the window.@>
The twilight covers the sky in this never-changing scene.@>
It's the typical, unremarkable scenery I'm so used to see every day.@>
The number of students in the classroom reduces little by little.@>
I hear their amused laughing voices and their funny chattering.#

{BLOCK:23}
As I listen to the bustling crowd, I wonder if what I experienced was actually real or just a byproduct of my delusions.#
My life hasn't changed in the slightest.@>
I get up at morning,@ come to school,@ and then sleep; rinse and repeat every day.@>
In the end, I'm just walking in circles in this big cycle we call our daily life.#

{BLOCK:24}
However, some people couldn't come back to that cycle.#

{BLOCK:25}
Kanako Ohta...@>
Yuki Yoshida and Miwako Katsuragi, the student council assistants...@>
Takuya Tsukishima, the former student council president...@>
and Ruriko, his little sister.#

{BLOCK:26}
They probably won't be able to spend the same daily lives as us anymore.#

{BLOCK:27}
After that, I contacted my uncle immediately and told him everything about the incident.@>
Without delay, he brought the teachers in charge of this case to school and found the five students in a comatose state.@>
When they arrived, the girls were sleeping close to each other in the student council room.#

{BLOCK:28}
When talked to, they remained unresponsive; they just kept staring at the emptiness of space, so it wasn't clear if they were alive or dead.@>
They were all in the same condition.@ Since one of them had a severe injury on her arm, my uncle promptly called an ambulance and took them to a nearby hospital.#

{BLOCK:29}
I heard from my uncle that they were sent to a psych ward.@>
I visited the ward once along with Ohta's best friend, Mizuho, but since they didn't allow visits we were expelled on the spot.@>
According to some students, they're beyond all hope of recovery.#

{BLOCK:30}
Afterwards, Saori and I were questioned by the police and the school board several times.@>
Of course, nobody believed the existence of electromagnetic waves, and the case was written off (rather ambiguously) as an episode of mass delusion.@ Personally, I think that outcome was inevitable.#

{BLOCK:31}
Suspicions about drugs as the cause of the incident grew stronger, but the investigators couldn't find any hard evidence and the case is still wrapped in a mistery.#

{BLOCK:32}
However, I know...@>
that it was all due to the electromagnetic waves and that Tsukishima (and perhaps Ruriko) released them.@>
Perhaps they tried to atone for their sins with their own hands.@>
At this point we have no way to know their real motive anymore.#

{BLOCK:33}
Under the afternoon sunlight, I observe the setting sun sinking into the horizon.@>
The beige curtains are swayed by the wind.@>
I find this scenery beautiful.@>
So the world was always this lovely, huh...?#

{BLOCK:34}
As I ponder about that...@>
{BGMSTOP}
{BG:001111}
"!"@>
Suddenly, the world before me is covered in darkness.#

{BLOCK:35}
W-What's going on?!@>
Something soft and warm envelops my face.@>
I quickly realize these are someone's hands.#

{BLOCK:36}
"Who-@am-@I?"@>
I hear that voice from behind.@>
I doubt anyone but Saori would play such mischief.#

{BLOCK:37}
"Saori, right?"@>
{CHABG:r13061107}
{BGMPLAY:07}
"Bingo!@ Hehehehe...@ Did I surprise you?"@, Saori says releasing her hands.@>
She peeks at my face smiling playfully.@>
{CHARA:r10}
"Hey, why so serious?"#

{BLOCK:38}
"Oh, it's nothing...@ I was just thinking the landscape is beautiful."@>
{CHARA:r16}
"Pffft, what a pretentious prick you are.@ Quit that grim face, c'mon...!"@>
Saori covers my mouth with a hand and hits my forehead with her fingertips.@>
"I-I think everybody thinks the same."@>
{CHARA:r13}
"Ah, you're blushing!"@>
"W-What's your problem?!"@>
"Hahaha!@ Sorry, sorry!@ I was just kidding!"\c
{CHARA:r10}
\e

{BLOCK:39}
So anybody thinks this setting is beautiful, huh?@>
I wonder if Ruriko and the others are able to feel this beauty...@>
I hope they do.@>
Even though their souls are trapped in a cold darkness, I'd like them to experience at least a little of the beauty and warmth of the real world.\c
{VISUAL:140000}
\e

{BLOCK:40}
"By the way, you free this Sunday?"@>
"Huh?@ Y-Yeah, I haven't anything planned."@>
"Really?@ Good!@ Wanna go to the movies with me?@ They're screening one I've been dying to watch!"@>
"Sure, no problem."#

{BLOCK:41}
"Neato!@ Can't wait for Sunday to come.@ It's a promise, okay?!"@>
Saori sticks out her pinky finger.@>
"Huh?"@>
"Let's do a pinky promise."@>
She flashes a wink.@>
"......"@>
I stare fixedly at her pinky.\c
{BGMFOUT}
{BG:000011}
\e

{BLOCK:42}
A pinky promise, huh?@>
That day I promised Ruriko like this in the rooftop.#

{BLOCK:43}
"You don't wanna do it?"#

{BLOCK:44}
She holds out her pinky finger narrowing her eyes.@>
I remember the innocent, cherubic face of Ruriko.@>
The empty rooftop under the early afternoon...@>
The gentle wind blowing past us...\c
{VISUAL:141100}
{BGMPLAY:12}
\e

{BLOCK:45}
"You won't promise?"@>
"Huh?"@>
I just noticed it, but Saori is pouting right in front of my face.@>
"Y-Yeah, let's do it..."#

{BLOCK:46}
I reach out the pinky finger of my right hand hesitatingly.@>
"What's wrong?"@>
"Ah, n-nothing.@ Pinky promise!"@>
I say holding out the pinky finger of my left hand.#

{BLOCK:47}
"Good!"@>
Saori smiles cheerfully, quits her right hand and holds out her finger of her left hand in order to do the promise.@>
"Pin-ky pro-mise..."#

{BLOCK:48}
I feel the fingertips in my right hand becoming hotter.#

{BLOCK:49}
"Promised!"@>
Giggling like a child, Saori peeks at my face.@>
"If you forget it, you'll eat a thousand needles!"@>
She winks once again.@>
"I'd never forget.@ I swear I never will.@ I promised, after all."@, I whisper, and Saori smiles bashfully.\c
{BG:000511}
\e

{BLOCK:50}
My endlessly-repeating daily life starts again.@>
My warm, peaceful days go on and on like a film reel, and I drift along that great river we call life.@>
I am nothing but a drop of that river.#

{BLOCK:51}
Before I realize it, the fear I experienced that night will probably fade away and the world will lose its color and sound again.@>
However, I think that will happen in the far, distant future.\c
{VISUAL:141105}
\e

{BLOCK:52}
"I hope we'll share classes next year."@, Saori whispers as she gazes at the setting sun.@>
"If that happened, we could be even closer to each other..."@>
Saori looks at me embarrassedly.@>
I smile to her in return.#

{BLOCK:53}
Saori hasn't mentioned that night ever again.@>
I'm not sure if she's actively dodging the topic or if she just didn't have the chance to talk about it yet.@>
As long as we can stay like we are now, that doesn't matter in the slightest.#

{BLOCK:54}
Saori is before me, and I'm before her.@>
As long as she's by my side, I don't think the colors of my world will fade out again.#

{BLOCK:55}
When I look around, there's no one besides us.@>
The crimson afternoon sun whose light leaks through the window projects our shadows on the wall.#

{BLOCK:56}
Two shadows approach each other until they become one.@>
The sky is as crimson as burning flames.@>
Embracing each other strongly, we melt away into its light.#
