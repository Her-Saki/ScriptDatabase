{BLOCK:0}
Giving off the dull radiance of steel, the tip of the blade gets closer to Saori's throat.@>
"Ah, aah, aaah..."@>
Shaking with fear, Saori opens wide her eyes, akin to a pair of marbles, and stares at the metal.@>
Her knees are shaking.@>
Her body is acting out of her will and it's about to end her own life.@>
I wonder if there's really something scarier than that.#

{BLOCK:1}
"Y-Yuusuke...@ N-No...@ Save me..."@>
A drop of red blood falls from her throat.@>
"I-It hurts...@ It hurts..."@>
Teardrops drip from her eyes.#

{BLOCK:2}
"Saori!"@>
If possible, I'd like to run over to her right now and slap those scissors off her trembling hands.@>
I'd like to relieve that fear-stricken face and tell her it'll be alright as I embrace her tight by her slender shoulders.@>
--However,@>
I can not do that.#

{BLOCK:3}
The girl I love is about to be killed.@>
Such is the scene developing before my very eyes, yet I'm unable to move an inch.@>
I've never cursed my own powerlessness so hard before in my life.@>
"Saori!@ Saori!@ Goddamit!"@>
My scream echoes pitifully in the surroundings.#

{BLOCK:4}
Saori turns to me and shows me a stiffened face.@>
"This is...@ only a dream, right?"@>
Those were Saori's last words.\c
{BGMPLAY:13}
{VISUAL:150606}
\e

{BLOCK:5}
The gray metal pierces Saori's throat.#

{BLOCK:6}
Bright blood spills from her throat and her uniform gets gradually covered in blood.@>
Her knees are shaking.@ With the scissors plunged into her throat, she falls on her knees to the floor.@>
Her body quivers with spasms.#

{BLOCK:7}
"Saori!@ Saori!"@>
Looking up at a fixed point in space, Saori twitches at regular intervals like a string puppet.#

{BLOCK:8}
Perhaps I can still make it.@>
If I remove the scissors thrust in her throat, cover her wound and take her to a hospital...@ If I scoop up her blood and return it to her body...@ If I cut my wrists and pour my blood into her wound...@>
I...@ I still can...@ do something...@>
"Sao... ri?!"#

{BLOCK:9}
"My electromagnetic waves can control other people's lives."@>
That's Tsukishima's voice.@>
I hear it like it comes from a different world altogether.\c
{BG:201010}
\e

{BLOCK:10}
Saori has been in the same pose for a while, but now her body tilts and she slowly falls to the ground.@>
Deep crimson blood seeps gradually on the ground.@>
Saori stops moving completely.#

{BLOCK:11}
"You're kidding, right?"@, I mutter.@>
This can't be real.@>
This has to be a lie!@>
This is all just a prank, isn't it?@>
Saori and Tsukishima plotted this farce to take me in.#

{BLOCK:12}
I bet the next instant Saori will get up and say "Just kiddin'!" with her usual merriness."@>
That's right.@>
No doubt about it.@>
This is all a lie.#

{BLOCK:13}
However, Saori doesn't budge.@>
Only her beautiful long hair waves in the cold wind.#

{BLOCK:14}
"That was enough, Saori..."@, I whisper.@>
"If you keep lying on the floor for too long you're gonna catch a cold..."@>
However, Saori doesn't move.@>
"I said it was enough.@ Stop this!"@>
Dim moonlight shines upon her body.#

{BLOCK:15}
"Answer me!"@>
Tears spill from my eyes as Saori's shadow twists and wriggles.@>
Tsukishima is saying something,@>
but I can't hear him well.#

{BLOCK:16}
A torrent of teardrops trickle down my cheeks and fall to the floor.@>
Eventually, I lose all light and I'm absorbed by a pitch black world.\c
{BG:000007}

{BGMPLAY:12}
\e

{BLOCK:17}
Saori is inside this darkness.@>
{CHARA:c16}
In this dark, gelid abyss, only her figure stands out brightly.@>
I see her chuckling while looking this way, and I wipe my tears and smile.@>
"Saori, you were deceiving me, weren't you?"\c
{CHARA:c13}
\e

{BLOCK:18}
"Hehehehe.@ Caught you by surprise, didn't I?@ It was all for funsies!@ I just wanted to scare you!"@>
Saori smiles mischievously and then flashes her trademark wink.@>
{CHARA:c99}
"Oh, did I make you mad?@ No!@ Please don't get angry!"@>
Saori pokes at my chest.#

{BLOCK:19}
"That was cruel, Saori.@ I was really worried about you."@>
I embrace Saori tight by her slender shoulders.@>
"My bad, I'm sorry..."@, Saori whispers in my ear.@>
"Don't leave me behind...@ I was enduring it, but actually I was scared too."#

{BLOCK:20}
Saori strokes my hair gently.@>
"Alright, I won't go.@ I'm not gonna part and leave you behind.@ So, don't leave me alone you too, okay?"@>
"Yes, of course.@ I love you, Saori."@>
"Hehe...@ It's a bit embarrassing, but...@ I'm happy.@ I love you too, Yuusuke."#

{BLOCK:21}
Amidst this dark pit, we strongly embrace each other.@>
Saori sheds a single teardrop which shines like a gem before bursting and disappearing.#

{BLOCK:22}
I won't ever let go of her hands.@>
I don't want she to go through all this again.@>
All of this nightmare...@>
She must not suffer it ever again...#

{BLOCK:23}
Nightmare?@>
What was that nightmare about again?@>
That question casually pops in my mind.@>
Why was I crying?#

{BLOCK:24}
Nah, it doesn't matter.@>
I don't want to think about that now.@>
I just want to keep embracing Saori inside this darkness forever.#

{BLOCK:25}
Just like this, forever...#
