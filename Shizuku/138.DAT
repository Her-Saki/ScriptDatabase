"--Fine."@>
"Huh?!"@>
{CHARA:r21}
Mizuho opens wide her eyes behind her glasses.@>
Clasping tight her hands, she faces me anxiously and waits for my follow-up.@>
"It's alright, let's investigate together."@>, I say shortly.@>
Mizuho's cloudy expression brightens up.\c
{CHARA:r22}
\e

{BLOCK:1}
"T-Thank you so much!@ I-I...!"@>
She realizes she's unintentionally screaming and hangs her head in shame.@>
"U-Umm, I promise I'll give it my best."@, she mutters looking at me upwards.@>
"But, lets get this straight first: as I said before, this investigation carries potential risks."\c
{CHARA:r20}
\e

{BLOCK:2}
"Yes, I know, but if something dangerous were to happen, I have to know about it.@ I mean..."@>
{CHARA:r24}
Mizuho takes her hand up to her chest.@>
"I mean, if that danger is the main cause of Kanako's breakdown, perhaps that's the key to open her heart!"#

{BLOCK:3}
"Mizuho..."@>
"Oh, b-but I promise won't cause you trouble at all.@ This is merely my personal issue."@, Mizuho says.@ After that she averts her gaze from me and keeps hanging her head.@>
She wants to do something for her best friend.@>
She can't stay silent about it.@>
That much I understand based on her behavior.#

{BLOCK:4}
I understand painfully well how she feels about Ohta.@>
She suffered a mental breakdown and became unresponsive to any verbal stimulus, just like a human vegetable.@>
If there's no hope of recovery for her, she might as well be considered functionally dead.#

{BLOCK:5}
Both the guilt she feels about her inability to prevent her breakdown and her wish to return her best friend to normal are urging her to join the survey.@>
At this rate, she'll eventually be overwhelmed by that sense of guilt.#

{BLOCK:6}
Also, as she is now, she looks like she lost sight of herself.@>
She's too emotional about this, which will ultimately lead her to take a dangerous path alone.@>
At least, that's how I see it.#

{BLOCK:7}
"That you "won't cause trouble"...?@ That this is your "personal problem"...?"@>
{CHARA:r20}
"Huh?"@>
Upon hearing my I mumbling, Mizuho looks at me wearing a slightly surprised face.@>
"At this point, I'm not unconnected to this case anymore.@ I want you to rely on me as I rely on you."\c
{CHARA:r23}
\e

{BLOCK:8}
"Yuusuke..."@>
"That's why you can't jump to danger alone.@ Let's help each other."@>
Mizuho bears an unfair sense of responsibility all by herself.@>
If someone doesn't support her, she'll be crushed under that weight.#

{BLOCK:9}
"T-Thank you very much."@>
Mizuho's large eyes dampen with tears.@>
"I...@ I..."@>
"Besides, you can't blame yourself too much about Ohta.@ Rushing things won't bring anything good."@, I say placing a hand on her shoulder.@>
"Yes..."@>
Mizuho wipes her tears with both hands.\c
{CHARA:r20}
\e

{BLOCK:10}
To be honest, I feel flustered.@>
This is the first time in my life I've said something so embarrassing.@>
I quickly bring back the original topic.@>
"The survey will be at night, so let's meet somewhere tonight.@ Hmm...@ A place without much people would be ideal.@ What about here?"@>
"Yes, okay.@ Around what time?"@>
"Hmm..."#

{BLOCK:11}
If memory serves me right...@ Last night Shinjo witnessed the fishy human-shaped shadows at 10 P.M.@ Next, the time where the ghost fuss took place was between 9 P.M and 10 P.M.@>
It'd be appropriate to start the search around 9 P.M and meet around 8 o'clock.@>
"By the way, were you about to visit Ohta now?"@>
"Y-Yes..."@>
Mizuho nods.#

{BLOCK:12}
"8 o'clock will be fine.@ Can you come then?"@>
"Yes, no problem."@>
"Okay then, right here at 8 o'clock."@>
"You got it."@>
I exchange that promise with Mizuho and then take my leave.\c
