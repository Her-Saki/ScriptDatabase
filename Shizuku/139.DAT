{BLOCK:0}
There's still plenty of time before our meeting.@>
Now that I'm back in the school building, I'm going to see my uncle one last time.@>
I head towards the staff room.#

{BLOCK:1}
"We must knock before entering a room".#

{BLOCK:2}
Just as the poster stuck on the entrance suggests, I knock twice and open the sliding door.@>
{BG:450303}
{BGMFOUT}
{BGMWAIT}
There aren't many teachers in the staff room after school, so it looks strangely deserted.@>
A young teacher sitting in the front row looks my way from a corner of their eye.@>
I give a slight bow, enter, and walk towards the seat of my uncle.#

{BLOCK:3}
Every desk of the staff is buried under a pile of textbooks and prints, but one among them has notoriously disorganized stashes.@>
Just as if he was shrouded by those papers, my uncle scores the exams as he sips tea from his teacup.@>
"Have a minute, uncle?"@>
I call him from behind, and he turns around with his teacup against his mouth.@>
{BGMPLAY:04}
{CHARA:C52}
"Hey, Yuusuke."@>
He gives another sip and leaves the teacup on the desk.@>
"Hold up, I'll be with you in a sec."#

{BLOCK:4}
He turns around to the desk once more and quickly grades the remaining tests.@>
Those are model exams of modern Japanese.@ Since my teacher is in charge, I guess they're from first year.@>
62 points... 47... 51...@>
Those can hardly be called good grades.@>
"Are these kids really studying...?"@>
As my uncle mumbles those complaints amid sighs of resignation, he takes up the pile with the last sheet on top and aligns it.@>
"Alright, all done."@>
He turns around his chair to face me.#

{BLOCK:5}
"So?@ How's it going?@ Did you meet Aihara and Shinjo?@ They went up to your class to talk with you, didn't they?"@>
"Yes, about that..."@>
I look around to make sure nobody is overhearing us, and then say in a low voice:@>
"Why did you tell them that I'm going to investigate?!"@>
""Why"?@ What do you mean "why"?"@>
"We can't say for sure they're not involved in this case."#

{BLOCK:6}
I tell him, and he smiles awkwardly with a slightly surprised face.@>
"Hey now, aren't you being too damn distrustful here?@ There's just no way that's true."@>
"I'm not suspecting of them!@ What I mean is that you're taking this too lightly."@>
My uncle lets out a choking cough.@>
"N-No, that's, uh...@ Ok, you got me, I'll be more careful from now on."@>
He takes his cup of tea and sips from it.#

{BLOCK:7}
"But still, aren't you a bit too high-strung about all this?@ You don't have to go that far, y'know?@ We don't even know if this story is true, after all."@>
"You're the man in charge!@ How can you be so careless?!"@>
"Oh, y-you're right."@>
"Get a hold of yourself, please."@>
Before my uncle's relaxed attitude, I feel like an idiot for keeping up the investigation so earnestly.#

{BLOCK:8}
"B-By the way, Yuusuke..."@>
My uncle changes topic forcibly.@>
"Did you obtain any useful info from those two?"@>
"Y-Yes, I suppose..."@>
"This morning Shinjo asked the volleyball club's head teacher, Kitazawa, to investigate the human-shaped shadows she saw last night because she found them creepy.@ She wanted to meet you too, so I asked her to talk with you if she bumped into you in the hallway."@>
I recall Shinjo imitating my uncle.#

{BLOCK:9}
"As for Aihara, I heard that she was a good old friend of Ohta, so I sent her to you after giving her the key.@ I thought you'd be able to get helpful hints while talking to her."@
"I did."@>
Actually, I already interviewed Mizuho and confirmed several details about Ohta's sudden transformation.#
"Oh, on that topic...@ I decided to take her with me to the survey tonight."@>
"You'll take Aihara?@ But why?"@>
"Well, things happened..."#

{BLOCK:10}
"It'll be late at night, so I'm not sure about bringing along a girl."@>
"She herself wanted to come at all costs."@>
"She said that she wanted to take part in the survey?"@>
"Yes."@>
"Why?@ Were you guys friends from before or something?"@>
"No, we weren't, but...@ one thing led to another..."@>
"Well, she's a member of the student council, and it seems she was a great friend of Kanako Ohta.@ She might be of help, alright."#

{BLOCK:11}
"I think so too, that's why I let her in."@>
"I left you in charge, so feel free to work in whatever way you see fit.@ That said, you're taking her along and I authorized it.@ If trouble arises we'll be both in deep shit.@ Don't let her near danger no matter what."@>
He stares at me with a serious look on his face.@>
"Yes, I understand."#

{BLOCK:12}
Next I share with my uncle the information I gathered up until now and today's survey plans.#

{BLOCK:13}
"Listen.@ If you bump into anything dangerous, don't try to solve it yourself.@ Give me a call and I'll head there immediately.@ "A wise man keeps away from danger", as they say.@ Got it?"@>
"Yes."#

{BLOCK:14}
"Also...@ I don't think I have to worry about YOU of all people, but don't forget Mizuho's a girl too, y'know?@ Don't cause any funny trouble, okay?"@>
Wrinkles develop at the corner of his eyes as he smiles mischievously.@>
""Funny trouble"...?@"
""Don't go for wool and come back shorn" is what I mean.@ Don't whip out your noodle just because nobody's watching your ass, you hear me?@>
"Wha--"@>
I'm at a loss for words.#

{BLOCK:15}
"I-I'd never...!"@>
"Hahaha.@ Just kidding.@ I know VERY well you're as sober as your father.@ You have my complete trust."@>
He turns around his chair and his back to me, then drinks up the last sips of tea remaining in the cup.@>
How could I forget it?@>
My uncle was always the kind of guy who can talk irresponsibly with a straight face.@>
As soon as the tension eases up, he immediately cuts short the talk and dodge the main subject by cracking jokes.#

{BLOCK:16}
"F-For starters, w-we just met a while ago..."@>
I look around relentlessly.@>
With his back turned to me, he just keeps laughing.@>
Looking at him like this, I feel extremely stupid for getting so excited before.@>
"Okay, just forget it."@>
"I'm counting on you, Yuusuke.@ You start 8 o'clock tonight, don't you?@ Be careful."@>
"Yes."@>
I answer half-heartedly.#

{BLOCK:17}
I feel like the tense thread hanging over me was just cut apart.@>
"Anyway, if you'll excuse me..."@>
"Whatever you find or don't find, don't ever forget to call me home."@>
"Sure, understood.@ See you later."@>
I say briefly and curtly before leaving the staff room.\c
{BGMFOUT}
{BGMNEXT:03}
{BG:430404}
\e

{BLOCK:18}
Why did he have to say that out of the blue?!@>
And in the freakin' staff room, to boot!@>
Now that he said that, I won't ever be able to stop thinking about Mizuho.#

{BLOCK:19}
Mizuho values her best friend like no other.@>
It's true that I feel bad for her, but I'm not letting her join this survey out of pity.@>
I'm not seeing her with lecherous eyes, either.@>
I'm just thinking logically.@ I think her knowledge will be useful for the investigation, so I approved her request.#

{BLOCK:20}
That said, I'm not completely uninterested in Mizuho as a girl.@>
To tell my honest feelings, I find her frankness and kindness to be really cute, and I'd be lying if I said I don't harbor any fondness for her.@>
I want to help her and support her.@>
Perhaps that's what it means to "like" someone.#

{BLOCK:21}
Unnecesary thoughts cross my mind thanks (or rather no thanks) to my uncle.@>
Now I'll be strangely conscious of her the next time we meet.@>
I feel my own cheeks heating up for no reason.#
