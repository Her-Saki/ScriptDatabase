It's 7:55 P.M.@>
I come to school five minutes earlier than our agreed time.\c
{BG:150303}

{BLOCK:1}
I walk to the garden where I'm supposed to meet Mizuho and wait for her there.@>
The school lights are turned off one by one.@>
The only lights left are those of the athletics club and those of the staff room.#

{BLOCK:2}
A chilly wind blows.@>
However, I don't feel any cold.@>
My body has been warm for a while now.@>
Enough to make me break a sweat...@>
It's been quite a while since I woke up from my fantasy, but my body is still burning.#

{BLOCK:3}
My crazy delusions become more realistic every passing day.@>
I'm growing more and more aware of the creepy genocidal impulses lodging in the depths of my mind.@>
Aware of the existence of that other side of me called "insanity".@>
The "me" who usually talks with my uncle and Mizuho is clearly different from the "me" who dreams about the apocalypse.@>
The former fears this eerie incident, but the latter is envious of Ohta who opened the door towards insanity and left behind this stupid world.#

{BLOCK:4}
Which one is the real me?@>
That silly question pops up in my mind and then disappears like a burst bubble.@>
I figure the answer immediately.@>
It's ridiculous...@>
I know that better than anyone.@>
It's obvious that BOTH are the real me.#

{BLOCK:5}
Sanity and madness.@ Pain and pleasure.@ Reality and fantasy.@ Normality and abnormality.@ Reason and desire.@ Restrain and freedom.#

{BLOCK:6}
I'm the combination of all those.#

{BLOCK:7}
As I think about that, our agreed time comes.@>
However, despite the clock marks five past eight, Mizuho's nowhere to be seen.#

{BLOCK:8}
I wait for another five minutes, but she's still not coming.#

{BLOCK:9}
What happened?@>
Did she forget the time?@>
No, that's not possible.@>
Either Mizuho forgot to come, or she's late for whatever reason.@>
I...\n\e
