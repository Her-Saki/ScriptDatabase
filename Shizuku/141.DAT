{BLOCK:0}
It's been another five minutes,@>
but Mizuho is nowhere to be seen.@>
8:15 P.M.@>
15 minutes have passed since our agreed time.@>
Perhaps she had an emergency that impeded her to come.#
Mizuho has a strong sense of responsibility.@>
I don't think she'd be late without a good reason.@ I'm sure there must be something else behind.#

{BLOCK:1}
That said, I'm not getting anywhere waiting here.@>
I'll wait for a bit more, and if she doesn't come by then, I'll give up and start the survey alone.#
We can't afford to waste time, after all.#

{BLOCK:2}
After that, three minutes more pass.@ I'm about to leave this place, when...@>
"Y-Yuusuke!"@>
I see Mizuho running over to me from the hallway, gasping.#

{BLOCK:3}
Mizuho spints towards me and holds her knees as she pants and her shoulders shake up and down.@>
{BGMFOUT}
{BGMWAIT}
{BGMPLAY:05}
{CHARA:c26}
"S-Sorry!@ I'm really sorry!"@>
Mizuho apologizes several times out of breath.@>
She looks quite pale.@>
Did something happen to her?#

{BLOCK:4}
"Mizuho...@ What did you...?"@>
When I talk to her and place a hand on her shoulder, she lifts up her face and looks at me.@>
Her eyes are full of tears.@>
"Y-Yuusuke!"@>
She is clearly upset.@>
"W-What's wrong?"@>
Large tears spill from her eyes and her shaking voice is sobbing.@>
"K-Kanako...@ Kanako is...!"#

{BLOCK:5}
Restless, she grabs the chest part of my uniform with both hands.@>
"A-Anyway, calm down.@ Did something happen?@ Speak slowly."@>
{CHARA:c29}
I softly place my hand on hers and open the hand holding my uniform.@>
Mizuho's hand is small, soft and very cold.@>
I grab it tight.#

{BLOCK:6}
"What happened with Ohta?"@, I ask her with a soothing voice.@>
{CHARA:c26}
"Kanako...@ disappeared!"@>
"That Ohta disappeared?"@>
Mizuho nods shedding tears.@>
"What do you mean she disappeared?"\c
{CHARA:c23}
\e

{BLOCK:7}
"She disappeared from the hospital she was in!@ When we went to visit her, her room was empty!"@>
She sobs convusely.@>
"Do you mean they moved her to another room or another hospital?"@>
Mizuho shakes her head.@>
{CHARA:c26}
"N-Not that!@ Kanako escaped from the hospital and went somewhere else!"@>
Her shoulders are quivering.\c
{CHARA:c23}
\e

{BLOCK:8}
"Kanako could barely walk by herself..."@>
Mizuho wipes her tears.@>
"H-Hold up.@ Up until just yesterday Ohta was in a coma like a human vege--"@>
I was about to say "human vegetable", but I stop.@>
"She was in a coma and was unresponsive, right?@ How come she escaped alone?"\c
{CHARA:c24}
\e

{BLOCK:9}
"Some people saw her leaving the hospital.@ The receptionist said she was wearing a jumper over her pajamas, and that she left through the front door..."@, Mizuho says hanging her head.@>
"We were just looking for her with her mother and friends..."#

{BLOCK:10}
"So that's why... you were late."@, I ask her, and Mizuho nods heavily as she wipes her tears.@>
"Judging by your uneasiness, it seems you haven't found Ohta yet."@>
"Yes."@, Mizuho answers.@>
{CHARA:c29}
She lifts up her face and looks into my eyes as she tightens her mouth.\c
{CHARA:c26}
\e

{BLOCK:11}
"I thought maybe Kanako came to school.@ I heard from Mr. Nagase that, since two or three weeks prior to her breakdown, she came to school almost every night..."\c
{CHARA:c24}
\e

{BLOCK:12}
True.@ She wrote something like that in her diary.@>
"2/21, I went to school tonight."@>
"2/23, I went to school tonight."@>
She wrote lines like that once per day.\c
{CHARA:c26}
\e

{BLOCK:13}
"That's why I thought Kanako might have come to school.@ I think she could be here!"\c
{CHARA:c24}
\e

{BLOCK:14}
Certainly.@ It's not unthinkable.@>
In her diary, Ohta demonstrated a pathological sexual desire, akin to a drug addict craving illicit substances.@>
If she's acting by instinct alone, it'd be most natural for her to come here.#

{BLOCK:15}
"Perhaps that's so.@ I think it's very likely for Ohta to be here.@ Well then, let's start checking out primarily the places where she could be."@>
{CHARA:c2A}
"T-Thank you so much, Yuusuke."@>
Mizuho covers her hand with her mouth and bows deeply.#

{BLOCK:16}
Just as you can't leave Ohta alone, I can't leave YOU alone.@>
Those words drifted casually through my mind but they never came out from my mouth.@>
And so we promtply start investigating.\c
