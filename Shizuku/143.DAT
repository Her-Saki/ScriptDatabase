{BLOCKLEN:16}

{BLOCK:0}
8:25 P.M.@>
At this time of day, the lights of the school building and the athletic club rooms are turned off one after the other.@>
There are still people in school, so we decide not to drop by the main building.@>
For the time being, we'll wait until everybody leaves the school while we survey around the hallways and the backyard.#

{BLOCK:1}
{BG:110404}
8:30 P.M.@>
The second gym, apparently suspicious according to Shinjo's testimony and the rumors of the ghost fuss, are being turned off as if the gym were about to be closed.@>
It seems the girls of the volleyball club, who stay up training more late that anybody else, are finally done cleaning up after their practice session.#

{BLOCK:2}
Now the lights of the main building, the second gym, the other athletic clubs and every other room are off.@>
As stated by Mizuho, thanks to the security system a company installed in our school, there are no teachers doing night guard.@>
That means that, except for both of us, soon the school will be emptied out.#

{BLOCK:3}
{BG:200404}
8:35 P.M.@>
A teacher goes into their SUV and leaves the parking lot, and a bit later, the last group of volleyball club girls cross the door.@>
Aside from me and Mizuho, there's nobody left in the surroundings.@>
Today the school fell silent relatively earlier than usual.#

{BLOCK:4}
Tonight is a full moon.@>
The perfectly round yellow moon hangs in the night sky and shines faintly upon the world.@>
Despite every light in the school building is off, we can look around us perfectly fine without relying on any other source of light.@>
{CHARA:c20}
"Who would have thought the moon would be so bright tonight..."@, Mizuho whispers as she gazes at her black shadow on the floor.#

{BLOCK:5}
We haven't found anything yet.@>
As I thought, it'd be better to narrow down our search points.@>
In this school devoid of all human presence, we officially start inspecting our surroundings.#

{BLOCK:6}
First off, we look in places where Ohta could be.@>
"Any hunch about Ohta's whereabouts?"@, I ask Mizuho, and after thinking for a while, she suggests we look into her classroom and the student council room.#

{BLOCK:7}
"Her classroom...@ Of course!@ After the student council, that's the place she's most used to visit.@ Kanako worked at the student council with me, after all."@>
Ohta served as vice president of the student council.@>
The student council room and her classroom, huh?@>
Her classroom was the same as mine, 2-B.@>
As for the student council room, it is located in the hallway where the after-school cultural club rooms are lined up.@>
Let's drop by there first of all.#

{BLOCK:8}
No matter what route we decide to take, we have to enter the main building first anyway, so we move to the front gate.\c
{BG:290404}
\e

{BLOCK:9}
Of course, the entrance door is locked with a key.@>
"In order to open it we need the key I gave you and releasing the electronic lock.@ There's a code for it, though..."@, Mizuho says.@>
"Don't worry.@ My uncle told me the code today."#

{BLOCK:10}
I input the code my uncle shared with me.@>
0...@ *Beep*...@ 8...@ *Beep*...@ 2...@ *Beep*...@ 4...@ *Beep*...@>
*Vrooom!*@ The electronic lock is released along with the roar of a motor.@>
I insert the master key in the hole and turn it, and after removing it, I slowly open the door.#

{BLOCK:11}
"But, wasn't this connected to the security company?@ I wonder if they found out I've just opened the door..."@, I tell Mizuho worriedly.@>
"No, this is only a lock.@ From what I've been told, the backroom inside the staff room and others are also locked like this."@>
Naturally, Mizuho is very well-versed about the school.@>
No wonder she's the secretary of the student council.@>
This is one of the advantages of bringing Mizuho along.\c
{BG:440606}
\e

{BLOCK:12}
We enter the main building from the front entrance.@>
The building is packed with an eerie quietness and cold air.@>
Not very surprisingly, there's no sign of people here.@>
I don't think anybody is inside.#

{BLOCK:13}
Now, what will we do?\n
\e

{BLOCK:14}
{XPOS:6}
{SPEED:0}
1. Go check out the classroom 2-B.\n
\e

{BLOCK:15}
{XPOS:6}
{SPEED:0}
2. Go check out the student council room.\n
