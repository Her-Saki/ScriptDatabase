"Okay then, let's check out the classroom."@>
"Yes."@>
We head to the 2-B classroom.\c
{BG:440404}
\e

{BLOCK:1}
The yellow moonlight coming from the window colors the hallway in such a way that it looks other-worldly.@>
Normally, we'd cross this hallway to go to our classrooms,@>
but now, a sense of impending danger floats in the air.\c
{BG:050303}
\e

{BLOCK:2}
We reach the classroom.@>
Despite we listen closely, it's still as quiet as always.@ There's no trace of anybody inside.@>
We open the door and enter.@>
It's empty.@>
The classroom is so silent it feels very creepy.@>
Our attempt to scout the premises ends in vain as well.@ I don't think we'll find any clue regarding the incident here, let alone find Ohta.#

{BLOCK:3}
I stand casually besides my seat and gaze at the whole classroom with a sweep of the eye.@>
"Looks like there's nothing here."@>
{CHARA:c24}
Mizuho crouches on the floor and opens wide her eyes in search of clues, but eventually gives up with a sigh of resignation.#

{BLOCK:4}
"Let's search elsewhere."@, I say, when...@>
{CHARA:c2B}
Mizuho stands before me, joins her hands, and stares at me intently.@>
"Yuusuke..."@, she whispers my name.@>
"Hm?@ What is it?"@>
"Um..."@>
It seems she has a hard time finding the appropriate words.@>
I realize that immediately.#

{BLOCK:5}
"You see..."@>
Mizuho lowers her gaze a bit and then looks my way once again.@>
{CHARA:c21}
"I'd like you to tell me more in detail about what happened.@ You know more about Kanako's activities in school and why she turned out like that, don't you?"@>
"W-Well, just a little..."#

{BLOCK:6}
"Perhaps she was just being considerate with me, but her mom...@ I mean, Kanako's mom didn't give me the full picture.@ She only asked me if we went together to school by night.@ Of course, I didn't know anything back then, so I wondered what was she talking about...@ But today, Mr. Nagase told me about it casually and...@ It was only a casual talk, but I kind of understood what went on..."#

{BLOCK:7}
Mizuho looks into my eyes.@>
"Did Kanako suffer that breakdown because she did something forbidden?@ Like... consuming illegal substances?"@>, Mizuho asks in a feeble voice.@>
"I don't know that much, but..."@>
I'm not sure how to follow up her question, so I answer vaguely.@>
{CHARA:c26}
"Tell me, please.@ I...@ I..."@>
Mizuho's eyes dampen.\c
{CHARA:c29}
\e

{BLOCK:8}
What should I do?@>
I know we're going to investigate together, but would it be alright to tell her everything?@>
She would hear the worst about her best friend.@>
I think that would sadden Mizuho even worse.@>
Teachers suspect she was either on drugs or alcoholized.@>
The medical check-up performed on her confirmed she had sexual intercourse as well.@>
Quite a tough topic to bring up.#

{BLOCK:9}
However, if I tell her the full story, I might obtain useful hints while talking to her.@>
What will I do?@>
I'm not sure about it.@>

{BLOCK:10}

1. Tell her everything as it is.\n
\e

{BLOCK:11}
{XPOS:6}
{SPEED:0}
2. I should keep it a secret.\n
