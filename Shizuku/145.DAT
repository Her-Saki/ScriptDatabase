"Alright, let's check out the student council room."@>
"Yes."@>
We move to the student council room.\c
{BG:500404}
\e

{BLOCK:1}
The student council room is located in the hallway where the cultural club rooms are lined up.@>
That hallway is windowless and looks more gloomy than the regular ones.@>
This is the second time we come here.@>
Despite I attend this school, I've never seen the council room inside up until just yesterday.@>
If I hadn't picked up this troublesome mission and kept going with my normal school life, I'd have graduated without ever seeing its interior.\c
{BG:181010}
\e

{BLOCK:2}
We stand before the door of the council room.@>
Mizuho gives a step forward in order to open it.@>
"Wait, take the key first."@>
I was about to take out the key I borrowed from my uncle from my pocket.@ However...@>
"It looks like it's already open, Yuusuke."@>
"Huh?!"@>
{BG:191010}
By the moment I lift my head, Mizuho already opened the door.\c
{BG:000000}
\e

{BLOCK:3}
The inside is pitch-black.@>
Mizuho enters the room and, with a truly experienced movement of the hand, she presses the light switch right next to the wall.@>
{BG:141106}
*Bzzzt!*@ The fluorescent lamp blinks and the room becomes illuminated.@>
Since Mizuho is the student council secretary, she knows this room as the palm of her hand.#

{BLOCK:4}
No one is inside.@>
"Why was the door open?@ Perhaps they simply forgot to close it?"@>
I try to converse to Mizuho.@>
{CHARA:c22}
"Maybe.@ Everyone is quite sloppy, so they often forget to shut the door.@ I mean, there's nothing to take from here in the first place."@>
Mizuho says with a faint smile.@>
However, her face quickly reverts to anxiety and restlestness.\c
{CHARA:c24}
\e

{BLOCK:5}
"But...@ maybe Kanako came here."@>
"Huh?@ Ohta?"@>
Mizuho examines the room closely, but after finding nothing of interest, she drops her shoulders and lets out a sigh.#

{BLOCK:6}
"Perhaps I'm just overthinking."@>
"No, I don't think it's too far-fetched.@ Maybe she was here just a while ago and then she moved to another place.@ Let's look for her elsewhere."@>
"Yes..."@>
We leave the room, and after closing and locking the door we go investigate to other places.#
