Now that we've come this far, I can't dodge this topic anymore.@>
I decide to tell Mizuho everything I know.@>
Even if I end up making Mizuho suffer as a result, this is something she herself chose.@>
Perhaps the less roundabout I am with her, the more smoothly the gears of our cooperation will spin, and it could prove benefitial to the investigation.#

{BLOCK:1}
Alright.@>
"Fine, I'll tell you..."@>
{CHARA:c29}
"Thank you."@>
With a dead-serious, determined expression on her face, Mizuho listens to my story.@>
I tell her everything in proper order.#

{BLOCK:2}
Three days ago during afternoon lessons, Ohta suffered a sudden psychotic attack which I personally witnessed.@>
She left a meaningful diary behind some days prior to said episode.@>
From the contents of that journal, several causes for her fit were surmised.@>
Alcohol, drugs, and... sex.@>
In a monotonous tone of voice, I tell her what I experienced, what I heard from I uncle, and every bit of information I've acquired up until now.\c
{CHARA:c24}
\e

{BLOCK:3}
"T-That's just..."@>
By the moment I finish telling her what happened, Mizuho's face has turned pale.@>
"I-I never imagined Kanako of all people would do something like that...@ I mean, I had no idea...@ She was perfectly fine just some days ago..."@>
Completely overwhelmed, her speech becomes disorganized.#

{BLOCK:4}
She was particularly shocked by the fact Ohta had sex days before the incident and that it was confirmed at the hospital after a medical check-up.@>
It's not my intention to rub salt into the wound when she's so upset, but there's something I absolutely have to ask her.#

{BLOCK:5}
"Perhaps you know who Ohta was dating since you're so close to her."@>
Mizuho lifts up her head which she was hanging low.@>
"T-This...@ This is the..."@, she whispers.@>
"Huh?@ What?"@>
"This the third time I've been asked that question; from Kanako's mom, from Mr. Nagase, and..."@>
Mizuho cuts herself short there.#

{BLOCK:6}
"It's very important.@ If we discover his identity, we'll know who she met the night previous to the incident.@ I think we'll be able to get a lot of information from him.@ It'd shed some light on the whole story of this case, which is still unclear, and perhaps we might even find out the real reason why Ohta lost her mind.@ Maybe that's "the key to open her heart" that you've been talking about."#

{BLOCK:7}
After hearing me out, Mizuho keeps her head low and doesn't answer for a while.@>
However, she eventually breaks the ice.@ She moves slowly her lips and the first thing that comes out her mouth is:
"I don't know.@ I have no idea."@>
"For real?"@>
"Yes.@ I told the same to the others.@ In fact, I'd like to know that myself."@>
By the end of her sentence, her voice vanished.#

{BLOCK:8}
Maybe she's lying, maybe she isn't, but I have no intention of questioning her further.@>
After all, she looks more distressed than I thought.@>
"I see.@ That's enough, then."@>
I cut the topic there and pat Mizuho's shoulder.@>
"Shall we go check out other places?"@>
{CHARA:c20}
"Yes..."#

{BLOCK:9}
We leave the classroom 2-B.\c
{BG:440606}

{BLOCK:10}
Since we came to the inside of the building, we take the chance to inspect the surroundings.@>
{BG2:441010}
We walk back and forth along the hallway.@>
Warm moonlight shines on the darkness.@>
Unfortunately, no matter how hard we stare or how closely we listen, we don't find anything of importance.\c
{BG:051010}
\e

{BLOCK:11}
We enter haphazardly at every classroom we pass by, but to no avail.@>
{BG:461010}
\e

{BLOCK:12}
The staff room.@>
There's no way they're holding those strange meetings here...\c
Ohta isn't here either.\c
{BG:481010}
\e

{BLOCK:13}
The second and third floor...@>
As I expected, there's nothing here either.#

{BLOCK:14}
Since we haven't found anything suspicious inside the building, we go look elsewhere.#
