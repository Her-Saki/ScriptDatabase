"Aside from the student council room and her classroom, do you know where else Ohta could have headed to?"@>
{CHARA:c20}
"Huh?@ Another place?"@>
"Somewhere you two used to go together."@>
{CHARA:c24}
Mizuho hangs her head and ponders about it a little.@>
And then, she gives a short answer.@>
{CHARA:c20}
"The rooftop."#

{BLOCK:1}
"The rooftop?"@>
{CHARA:c22}
"Yes.@ We used to have lunch in the rooftop together every break."@>
"Alright, let's go see if she's there."@>
"Okay."\c
{BG:480303}
\e

{BLOCK:2}
We both move to the stairs that lead to the rooftop.#

{BLOCK:3}
Casting her gaze to the floor, Mizuho has been thinking about something all the way from the classroom.@>
Was it too big of a shock for her?@>
Perhaps I should have summarized my explanation of the case instead of telling her every single detail.@>
I climb the stairs slowly trying to match my pace to hers and not separating too much from her.#

{BLOCK:4}
Mizuho is the type of person that tends to jump to conclusions, and the more she worries about something, the more seriously she thinks about it.@>
Maybe I should talk with her about anything in order to distract her from said thoughts.@>
Keeping silence for so long in this dark school feels creepy to me.@>
Halfway through the stairs that connect the second and third floor, I suddenly come to a halt and call out to Mizuho.#

{BLOCK:5}
"Mizuho..."@>
Mizuho lifts her face abruptly.@>
"Y-Yes...?"\c

{BLOCK:6}
At that very instant, she slips on the stairs and stumbles.@>
"Ah!"@>
Her balance staggers and she's about to fall on her back.@>
"Watch out!"\c

I reach out my arm right away to catch her.#
