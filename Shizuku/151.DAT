Mizuho loses her balance and starts leaning forward, but I quickly grab her from behind.@>
"Eeek!"@>
Supported by my arms, she barely manages to hold her footing.#

{BLOCK:1}
Initially, when I grab Mizuho, it feels like I'm only holding her uniform, as if it were packed with air inside and it lacked all substance.@>
It's because her body is very slender and dainty.@>
Her shoulders are slim, her back is thin...@ and overall her body is as light as a feather.#

{BLOCK:2}
"Y-Yuusuke..."@>
For some reason, Mizuho remains dead-quiet as I support her.@>
"U-Umm..."@>
Mizuho speaks with a slightly hoarse voice.@>
"M-My chest..."@, she says placing one of her palms on my hand on her chest.#

{BLOCK:3}
"Ah!"@>
I finally realize it.@>
I was grabbing Mizuho's bosom tight with my palms.@>
To be honest, I didn't notice it at all.@>
Her plain chest couldn't be called big by any reasonable measure.@ When touching it through her uniform, I could barely feel like I was touching something soft, but nothing else; I almost didn't feel anything behind it.\c

\e

{BLOCK:4}
"S-Sorry!"@>
I apologize on the fly and quickly let go of her chest.@>
"I-It wasn't on purpose!@ I-I didn't know I was touching you..."@>
"Huh?"@>
Mizuho's face flushes red like a burning candle.#

{BLOCK:5}
"Ah!@ I-I didn't mean it THAT way!@ I'm not saying they were tiny or anything..."@>
Goddammit!@>
What the hell am I on about?!@>
"I-It's just I didn't feel anything when I touched them...@ Uh...@ No, that's not what I mean either!"@>
Kill me please.\c
{CHARA:c21}
\e

{BLOCK:6}
"S-Sorry!"@>
Mizuho apologizes needlessly.@>
"Huh?!@ W-Why are YOU apologizing...?"@>
{CHARA:c28}
She covers her chest with both hands, blushes embarrassedly, and hangs her head.@>
An incredibly awkward silence takes place.#

{BLOCK:7}
I have to say something.@>
I know I should break the ice, but my mind is blank and no decent follow-up comes to my mind.@>
I gotta speak up!@>
I'll start by opening my mouth.\c
{CHARA:c21}
\e

{BLOCK:8}
"Um...!"@>
"Um...!"#

{BLOCK:9}
We speak at the same time and our voices overlap.@>
"W-What?"@>
I give immediately the right to speak to her, especially because I didn't think about what to say next.#

{BLOCK:10}
Blushing furiously, Mizuho peeks at my face from below and looks into my eyes.@>
{CHARA:c27}
"U-Umm..."@>
She's at a loss for words.@>
"Y-Yes?"@>
"U-Ummm..."@>
"What is it?"#

{BLOCK:11}
"D-Do you think they're small?"@>
"Huh?!"@>
Mizuho asks me with her face reddened.@>
"D-Do you mean your chest?"@>
{CHARA:c28}
She nods.#

{BLOCK:12}
What?!@>
W-What should I say in a moment like this?\n
\e

{BLOCK:13}
{XPOS:6}
{SPEED:0}
1. Yes, I think they're small..\n
\e

{BLOCK:14}
{XPOS:6}
{SPEED:0}
2. Some people like them small.\n
\e

{BLOCK:15}
{XPOS:6}
{SPEED:0}
3. I-I think they're average.\n
