"I-It's true.@ They're kinda small-sized..."@>
Mizuho looks at me with a bright red face.@>
"B-But that's not something you should be so self-conscious about."@>
"....."@>
"Y-Y'know what they say, big breasts make your shoulders stiff and whatnot..."@>
I keep the conversation going with that compassionate, yet nonsensical argument.#

{BLOCK:1}
"M-My friends use to say I'm childish, even about my height..."@>
Mizuho begins to talk in a low voice.@>
{CHARA:c24}
"Well, it's true that you're growing at a slower pace than everyone, but you're not SO flat-chested that your breasts are unnoticeable when you touch them..."@>
I say, and she drops her gaze again.@>
Perhaps she's really THIS self-conscious about this topic.#

{BLOCK:2}
"N-No, perhaps "unnoticeable" isn't the right word...@ I mean, you have still the soft breasts of a young girl..."@>
W-What the hell am I even saying?!@>
{CHARA:c28}
"......"@>
Mizuho's cheeks become even more red.@>
Awkwardly, I throw the next quick follow-up:@>
"B-Besides, I think they'll grow bigger over time."@>
The more I fight the quicksand, the worse it gets...#
