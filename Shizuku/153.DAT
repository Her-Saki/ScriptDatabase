"B-But...@ Umm...@ Some people like them small..."@>
Mizuho stares at me with her face bright red.@>
"I think that size suits you best."@>
I add that nonsensical comment as a follow-up.@>
{CHARA:c2B}
"D-Do you mean I'm childish?"@>
"N-No, that's not what I said..."\c

{BLOCK:1}
"M-My friends use to say I'm childish, even about my height..."@>
Mizuho begins to talk in a low voice.@>
"Well, it's true that you're growing at a slower pace than everyone, but you're not SO flat-chested that your breasts are unnoticeable when you touch them..."@>
I say, and she drops her gaze again.@>
Perhaps she's really THIS self-conscious about this topic.\c

{BLOCK:2}
"N-No, perhaps "unnoticeable" isn't the right word...@ I mean, you breasts are small, but adorable..."@>

Mizuho's eyes dampen little by little.@>
This is not working!@>
I gotta think about more tactful follow-ups!#

{BLOCK:3}
"I-I, for one, love flat chests like yours!"@>
{CHARA:c20}
Mizuho looks at me astonished.@>
--OH, CRAP!@>
What the hell did I just say?!@>
The more I fight the quicksand, the worse it gets...#
