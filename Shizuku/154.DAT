"M-My friends use to say I'm childish, even about my height..."@>
Mizuho begins to talk in a low voice.@>
"Well, it's true that you're growing at a slower pace than everyone, but you're not SO flat-chested that your breasts are unnoticeable when you touch them..."@>

"B-Besides, I think they'll grow bigger over time."@>
The more I fight the quicksand, the worse it gets...#
