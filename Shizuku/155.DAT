Before I sink deeper, I'll deviate from the chest topic.@>
"B-By the way, aren't you hurt?"@>
That's the very first thing that I managed to say.@>
{CHARA:c28}
"No."@, Mizuho answers in a low voice with a bright red face as she averts her gaze.@>
And then she stops the conversation again.#

{BLOCK:1}
"......"@>
"......"#

{BLOCK:2}
While equally tense, a different atmosphere from before floats in the air.@>
We're strongly aware of each other and not only we can't converse, but we can't look at each other in the eye either.@>
I'm clearly more nervous than her.@>
I've never talked to a girl before like this, let alone in private.@>
I don't know what to say next.\c
{BGMFOUT}
{BGMWAIT}

{BLOCK:3}
{BGMPLAY:06}
{PCMLOAD:14}
However, it's Mizuho who breaks the ice first.@>
{CHARA:c21}
"S-Sorry.@ You saved me from danger and I just said strange things..."@>
{CHARA:c28}
She drops her gaze to the floor blushing.#

{BLOCK:4}
{PCMPLAY:0040}
*Ba-Bump*@ *Ba-Bump*@>
I hear my own heartbeats.@>
The blood across my body pumps vigorously.@>
"N-No, I should apologize."@>
I apologize in a lot of meanings.\c
{CHARA:c21}
\e

{BLOCK:5}
"U-Um, I'm really sorry..."@>
Mizuho apologizes.@ "Sorry" must be her catchphrase.@>
We surely look like idiots apologizing to each other.@>
{CHARA:c24}
"I...@ lied."@>
{PCMSTOP}
{PCMFOUT}
Mizuho says all of a sudden.@>
"You lied?"#

{BLOCK:6}
"Yes...@ Back when we were in your classroom this afternoon I said I was athletic, but..."@>
"Huh?@ O-Oh, yeah..."@>
I recall she said that.@>
"That was...@ a lie."@>
Mizuho looks my way apologetically.#

{BLOCK:7}
"Actually, I'm terrible at sports.@ I usually space out and trip or bump against stuff...@ and a result, I often hurt myself."@,>
{CHARA:c28}
Mizuho whispers bashfully.@>
"I thought you'd reject me on the spot if I told you that, so..."@>
She bows deeply.#

{BLOCK:8}
Oh, so that's what she lied about.@>
I'm so relieved...@>
It seems the previous topic is over.@>
{CHARA:c21}
"S-Sorry!"@>
Mizuho keeps lowering her head.@>
"I-It's okay, I understand."@>
"I'm really sorry..."#

{BLOCK:9}
"I'm not mad.@ More importantly, let's hurry up to the rooftop."@>
"Yes."@>
Mizuho lifts up her head and nods.@>
{CHARA:c2A}
"Thank you, Yuusuke..."@, she says smiling happily.#

{BLOCK:10}
"......"@>
Upon seeing her smile, my heart skips a beat.@>
W-What is this feeling...?@>
My cheeks are becoming hotter.@>
I start climbing the stairs so that Mizuho doesn't notice it.\c
{CHARA:c99}
{BGMFOUT}
{BGMWAIT}
{BGMPLAY:03}
\e

{BLOCK:11}
We were walking up the stairs once again, when...#

{BLOCK:12}
*Doo-room*#

{BLOCK:13}
Something hard drops to the floor.@>
{CHARA:c21}
"Ah!"@>
Mizuho stops walking and lets out a little scream.@>
I turn around and notice a small woodden box near her feet.@>
{CHARA:c99}
She quickly crouches and picks up the little box with great care.\c
{CHARA:c20}
\e

{BLOCK:14}
"What is that?"@, I ask.@
{CHARA:c22}
"This is..."@>
Mizuho makes sure the small, match-box sized woodden box is not scratched and sighs in relief.@>
"This is a music box my father gave me as his last present."@>
"A music box memento?"#

{BLOCK:15}
"Yes.@ When you open it...@ Ta-dah!"@, Mizuho says opening the lid.\c
{BGMFOUT}
{BGMNEXT:22}
{VISUAL:170707}
\e

{BLOCK:16}
Certainly, the small casket is indeed a music box.@>
Its harmonious melody echoes under the faint moonlight.#

{BLOCK:17}
Mizuho closes her eyes and slowly tells me about it.@>
"Just a week before I entered high school, I lost my father in a car accident.@ He gave me this music box just before he passed away."#

{BLOCK:18}
Suddenly, Mizuho lifts up her face and smiles bitterly.@>
"Ah, perhaps I'm making it sound like it's something really valuable, but actually, it's only a cheap, generic ornament.@ I saw it next to a cash register when we went out to eat to a family restaurant and threw a fit to obtain it, and my dad bought it for me.@ It's just a cheap toy."@>
She holds the box tight.#

{BLOCK:19}
"That said, it's still the last thing my dad bought for me.@ It'll always be my father's memento for me."@>
Mizuho gazes warmly at the music box.@>
"When I just entered middle school, I never let go of this box.@ I felt like my father was always by my side."\c
{CHABG:c2A480505}
\e

{BLOCK:20}
"Why did you bring so precious a thing here?"@>
"This is not only the memory of my father, but Kanako's too."@>
"Ohta's memory?"@>
"Yes.@ It happened soon after I entered middle school..."@>
Mizuho lifts her gaze as if strolling down memory lane and keeps telling me the story as she looks at the bright moon outside the window.#

{BLOCK:21}
"After my father passed away, we moved from the city we always lived in and I enrolled in a school I wasn't planning to go."@>
{CHARA:c24}
Mizuho's eyes darken out.@>
"There were kids I didn't know everywhere.@ I was always bad at making friends, so at first I almost didn't talk with anybody.@ I was in a corner of the main building listening to this music box alone."@>
Her gaze turns to the music box once again.#

{BLOCK:22}
"A certain day, a group of boys of my class came to play a a prank on me as I was listening to the music box in the courtyard.@ Now that I think about it, it was only a silly prank, so they picked my music box and used it to play catch."@>
"That's so mean..."@>
{CHARA:c2A}
"Ah, but there was a lawn below, so I don't think it'd have broken if it fell."@>
Mizuho adds quickly.@>
You don't have to be gentle with bullies...\c
{CHARA:c24}
\e

{BLOCK:23}
"But, at the moment, I felt that my dad was being bullied instead of me, so I feel frustrated.@ I repeated "stop, stop!" while crying, but I couldn't do anything but cower on the ground..."@>
Mizuho's eyes dampen.@>
However, the next instant, she lifts up her face and smiles cheerfully with her eyes full of tears.@>
{CHARA:c22}
"But then, Kanako came to my rescue."\c
{VISUAL:180505}
\e

{BLOCK:24}
"Kanako saw they were bullying me and came to help me alone, even though we've never met before..."@>
A single teardrop flow from her eye.@>
"Despite Kanako was beaten by the boys, she never gave a step behind and returned the music box to me.@ She cut her lip, but she said she was fine."@>
Mizuho wipes the teardrop trickling down her cheek with her sleeve.#

{BLOCK:25}
"And then I asked Kanako why she helped me, and she..."@>
She lifts up her crying face and smiles gently.@>
"Kanako smiled happily while pointing to this music box, and said she wanted to hear it."@>
Her shoulders shake as large teardrops flow down her eyes.#

{BLOCK:26}
"I-I wanted to thank her immediately, b-but my tears didn't allow me to mutter much of a word.@ Even so, Kanako kept asking me if I was fine."@>
Mizuho grabs the music box with both hands as if enveloping it, closes her eyes and takes it up to her chest ever so dearly.@>
"Since then, Kanako became my unconditional friend..."\c
{BGMFOUT}
{BGMNEXT:06}
{CHABG:c2A480505}
\e

{BLOCK:27}
"And, that's the music box of your memories?"@>
{CHARA:c24}
"Yes.@ Every time she came to my house she'd open the music box and say "what a beatiful sound" or "this brings me back" and things like that.@ I thought maybe this would help me to restore Kanako to normal."@>
Mizuho's desperate efforts to help her friend crush my heart.#

{BLOCK:28}
"I took it to the hospital she was in, and then I came straight here..."@>
Mizuho saves her music box with utmost care inside her pocket.\n
