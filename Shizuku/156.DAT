"Can you show me that music box?"@>
{CHARA:c20}
"Yes."@>
Mizuho takes out the small woodden box from her pocket and hands it to me.@>
{VISUAL:170808}
{BGMFOUT}
The music box, whose size fits just right in my palm, feels way lighter than I thought.@>
It's designed so that the music starts to play as soon as you open the cover.@>
I open the box gently.\c

{BLOCK:1}
Perhaps it's because the inner springs are almost unwound, but the music box plays a feeble melody until eventually loses all its power and stops working.@>
"Ah, please wind the horizontal springs."@>
"Like this?"@>
"Yes, with that lever."@>
I wind the springs with a rattling sound.@>
After I let go of the lever, the music box starts again, this time playing a sweet melody.\c
{BGMPLAY:22}

{BLOCK:2}
If this music is deeply rooted in her memories, perhaps it can help to produce some sort of response in Ohta.@>
Mizuho's wholehearted wish to save her friend lead her to try every possible method to accomplish it.@>
I feel that the resonance of this music box is the voice of Mizuho's tender heart itself.\c

"As long as you keep her in your heart, Ohta will someday go back to her usual self.@ That's what I feel."@>
I say closing the lid of the box.@>
I'm not trying to console her.@ I mean every word I say.@>
{CHARA:c2A}
"Y-Yuusuke..."@>
Mizuho wipes her tears with the back of her hand.@>
"T-Thank you so much..."@>, she says smiling.#
