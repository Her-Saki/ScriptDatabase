{BG:190303}
We climb up the stairs, open the iron door, and step into the rooftop.@>
{BG:331010}
A cold wind blows.@>
We look around us, but no one is there.@>
"Not a soul on sight, huh?"@>
Ohta's not here, either.#

{BLOCK:1}
{PCMLOAD:01}
A big, yellow, perfectly round moon hangs in the sky.@>
Under the faint moonlight, we look as radiant as pale flames.@>
Our shadows are sharply projected on the floor.#

{BLOCK:2}
{PCMPLAY:0100}
{PCMWAIT}
{PCMSTOP}
{PCMFOUT}
A cold gust of wind blows past our feet and makes Mizuho's skirt flap.@>
She looks around relentlessly.@>
There are still a lot of blind spots to check out, such as the water tank up high and the back of the entrance door.@>
We can't say for sure Ohta isn't in one of those places.\c
{CHARA:r20}
\e

{BLOCK:3}
"Let's look around a bit."@>
"Yes..."@>
Along with Mizuho, I look around into every nook and cranny.@>
{CHABG:r20330404}
However, in our first round we don't find a single human-shaped shadow.@>
It seems we're completely alone here.#

{BLOCK:4}
"If they're not here, perhaps they didn't come to school in the first place."@>
{CHARA:r24}
"Kanako..."@, Mizuho whispers hanging her head low.@>
"If we had a bit more information, we could at least pinpoint Kanako's whereabouts."@>
"......"@>
Always looking at the rooftop floor, she stands frozen in place.#

{BLOCK:5}
As a viewing platform, this place is ideal.@>
I can watch over the front and back door with a sweep of the eye and observe clearly the cherry trees of the second gym that Shinjo was talking about.@>
With a night as clear as this one, I will be able spot anybody approaching the school immediately.@>
It'd be a good idea to hide here and stand watch.#

{BLOCK:6}
However, I should leave that aside for today and help Mizuho search for Ohta.@>
I choose to leave the rooftop.@>
"It seems we're just wasting time patrolling here.@ Let's go already."@>
But just when I was telling that to Mizuho...@>
"Yuusuke..."@>
Mizuho suddenly calls my name.#

{BLOCK:7}
"Huh?"@>
{CHARA:r21}
"Sorry."@>
I don't know what happened, but Mizuho apologizes out of the blue.@>
She drops her gaze to the floor apologetically and stares to the black shadow projected sharply at her feet.@>
"What do you mean?"\c
{CHARA:r24}
\e

{BLOCK:8}
"I...@ lied to you again."@, Mizuho says in a low voice as she looks downwards.@>
"You lied?@ About what?"@>
With a painful expression, Mizuho directs her gaze towards me.@>
"U-Umm..."@>
"Yes?"@>
"Y-You see..."@>
Mizuho exhales deeply.@ Her expression becomes serious as if she strenghtened her resolution and fixes her gaze on my face.\c
{CHARA:r2B}
\e

{BLOCK:9}
"I said I had no clue about the identity of Kanako's boyfriend, right?"@>
"Yes."@>
"I said I didn't know anything, but actually..."@>
Mizuho cuts herself short there.#

{BLOCK:10}
"You know who it is?"@>
Mizuho hesitates for a while, but eventually she nods.@>
"Why did you confess so suddenly?"@>
{CHARA:r24}
"I promised I wouldn't tell anyone..."@, she whispers.@>
"To Ohta?"@>
"--Yes."#

{BLOCK:11}
Mizuho takes a short, deep breath and moves her heavy lips.@>
"Kanako told me about him from long ago.@ She had a crush on him since second year and asked me for advice a lot of times..."@>
Perhaps strolling down memory lane, a gentle smile appears on Mizuho's face.#

{BLOCK:12}
"Kanako was madly in love with him.@ She confessed to me that she struggled every day because of that.@ I told her to give it her best shot and that I'd be cheering for her."@>
A cold gust of wind strokes Mizuho's hair.#

{BLOCK:13}
"Last year fall Kanako confessed to him at once.@ That day I was hidden behind her.@ He accepted Kanako's confession and she was moved to tears.@ I cried along with her too."@>
Kanako starts tearing.#

{BLOCK:14}
"Since then, I thought both of them were doing it well.@ No, actually, they're still doing it well.@ I mean, today..."@>
"Today?"@>
"......"@>
Mizuho falls silent and becomes quiet.#

{BLOCK:15}
"Mizuho..."@>
"Yes?"@>
"Please tell me his name."@>
{CHARA:r21}
"B-But..."@>
Mizuho says looking at me with a troubled face.@>
"If you went your way to tell me this it means you are willing to tell me EVERYTHING, doesn't it?"@>
{CHARA:r24}
"T-That's true, but..."#

{BLOCK:16}
Along with a deep sigh, she shakes her head and drops her gaze.@>
"I-I don't know what to do.@ I mean, I promised.@ I promised it to Kanako..."#

{BLOCK:17}
The promise to her best friend and the hint to reveal the truth.@>
For her both are important.@>
Entrapped between both, Mizuho doesn't know how to proceed and just stands there distressed.#

{BLOCK:18}
"Listen, Mizuho.@ I can't put it well into words, but I think what matters the most now is doing something for Ohta."@, I say, and Mizuho lifts up her face and looks my way.@>
{CHARA:r2B}
"If you can do something, no matter how little it is, you have to do it.@ Perhaps the person you mentioned has the key to open Ohta's heart.#

{BLOCK:19}
After I say that, Mizuho ponders about something for a while.@>
However, eventually, she slowly opens her mouth.@>
{CHARA:r24}
"--Okay."@, she says.@>
"Will you tell me?"@>
"--Yes."@>
She nods.#

{BLOCK:20}
"That person is...@ Tsukishima.@ He's a third-year student that served as the student council president last semester."@, Mizuho says.#
