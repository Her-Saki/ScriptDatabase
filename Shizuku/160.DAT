Now that I remember, I bumped into Tsukishima today after school on my way to visit Mizuho at the student council.@>
{CHABG:r40490505}
Tsukishima, a third year student, is just waiting for graduation, so he doesn't have any need to come to school.@>
I wonder if he has some business here.\c
{CHABG:r24330505}
\e

{BLOCK:1}
"Today Tsukishima went to visit Kanako at the hospital as usual, and after that he dropped by the student council room."@>
I see, so that's where I met him...@>
I connect the dots thanks to Mizuho's explanation.#

{BLOCK:2}
"Tsukishima was really worried about Kanako, and he seemed quite depressed.@ I was right besides him and he looked so pitiful..."@>
Mizuho seems to be distressed.@>
"When I heard your story, I thought maybe Kanako's breakdown happened after meeting her partner the day previous to the incident, but after seeing Tsukishima like that, I don't believe that's the case at all."#

{BLOCK:3}
Judging by her demeanor, I take it that Mizuho trusts Tsukishima wholeheartedly.@>
I don't know him personally, so I can't reply anything.@>
Mizuho keeps talking.@>
"Tsukishima is a really good person.@ Since Kanako started dating him, she became a lot brighter.@ I don't think she did anything of what Mr. Nagase suspected she did."#

{BLOCK:4}
"Please don't question their relationship."@>
While she didn't say that explicitly, that's what Mizuho tried to convey.@>
"It's not like I find him totally suspicious.@ Also, if I ask him about what happened, perhaps we could gather a big clue."#

{BLOCK:5}
"You're... right..."@>
However, Mizuho looks unconvinced.@>
I still hold doubts about revealing her the truth about Tsukishima.#

{BLOCK:6}
"Anyway, let's go elsewhere.@ We're doing no progress staying here."@>
"Yes."@>
I first make sure Mizuho is ready to go; she nods and I step into the exit door.\c
{BGMFOUT}
\e

{BLOCK:7}
Then...\c
{CHABG:r26361010}
\e

{BLOCK:8}
"Y-Yuusuke!@ Look!"@, Mizuho screams of all a sudden as she points to the front door.@>
{CHARA:r29}
I face to the direction she's indicating.@>
"Wha--?!"#

{BLOCK:9}
It's a person!@>
There's someone there!@>
A human-shaped shadow stands near the front gate.@>
Like a spotlight, the yellow moonlight shines on that shadow.@>
It's a girl in casual clothes.@>
She crosses the front gate, walks along the row of cherry trees of the second gym and then heads towards the main building.\c
{CHARA:r26}
{BGMPLAY:05}
\e

{BLOCK:10}
"I-It's Kanako...@ It's Kanako!"@, Mizuho shouts.@>
"Huh?!"@>
"That was Kanako, Yuusuke!@ There's no doubt!"@>
She gets completely into a panic.@>
"Q-Quick!@ Let's hurry up, now!"@>
Mizuho pulls my sleeve repeatedly.#

{BLOCK:11}
Is it really Ohta?@>
I can't tell from here.@>
"No, let's observe what happens for a while more from here.@ We have to make sure where she's heading to."@>
{CHARA:r21}
"B-But..."@>
"If we don't, we'll lose sight of her."@>
"......"@>
{CHARA:r2B}
While she doesn't calm down, she obeys reluctantly.@>
We lower our heads and move to a corner of the rooftop.#

{BLOCK:12}
We spy through the fence and observe that shadow that resembles Ohta.@>
Unfortunately, I can't see her face well from here.@>
{CHARA:r24}
"Where is Kanako going...?"@>
Mizuho gazes at the shadow anxiously.@>
She probably wants to jump to where she is right now.#

{BLOCK:13}
We track Ohta's shadow with our eyes.@>
The shadow approaches the east building and stands before the emergency exit next to the stairs.@>
She easily opens the door.@>
It doesn't seem to be locked.@>
"--Was it unlocked?"@>
But when...?@>
Perhaps someone opened it from inside beforehand.@>
That's the only possibility I can think of.#

{BLOCK:14}
The Ohta-like shadow enters the east building from the emergency exit.@>
*Slam*@ She closes the door.@>
"Where is she heading to...?"@, I whisper facing Mizuho with my head hanging low.@>
{CHARA:r21}
"That area is...@ around the student council room."@>
"Was that door opened when we went there before?"@>
"Sorry, I didn't notice."#

{BLOCK:15}
"Anyway, it seems it was unlocked from the start.@ Not sure if it was always opened or if someone opened it right now, though..."@>
I stand up as I say that.@>
"It's almost as if someone was waiting for Ohta to open it."@>
"Let's head to the east building!"@>
Mizuho stands up too.@>
"Yes."\c
{CHARA:r2B}
\e

{BLOCK:16}
"Since she went through that door, I think Kanako is in the student council room now."@>
"But we just locked that door.@ She won't be able to open it..."@>
"Anyway, let's go.@ I have no doubt it's her."@>
It seems Mizuho wants to go with Ohta as soon as possible.@>
"Fine."@>
We quickly leave the rooftop.\c
