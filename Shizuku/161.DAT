{BLOCKLEN:40}

{BLOCK:0}
The hallway where the student council room is located retains its usual frozen quietness.@>
I don't think there's anobody besides us.@>
Light music club, photography club, acting club, chemistry club, tea ceremony club, art club...@ The nameplates of every cultural club are neatly lined up next to each other.@>
Only the sound of our breathing after running up to here echoes through the dim hallway under the yellow moonlight.#

{BLOCK:1}
Mizuho stands before the door as she gasps painfully.@>
"I'm sure Kanako is inside here."@>
Mizuho holds no doubt that the shadow we saw before was Ohta.@ She's convinced that her friend is in here.@>
She grabs the cold metal knob,@>
but then...#

{BLOCK:2}
"Nh...@ Nnh..."@>
"Nhah...@ Aanh..."#

{BLOCK:3}
"!"@>
Upon hearing such voices, Mizuho startles and lets go of the knob.#

{BLOCK:4}
There are people there!@>
That much is clear.@>
These are female voices.@>
They sound like moans.@>
It's just as Mizuho said: the student council room was empty before, but now some people are inside.#

{BLOCK:5}
"Ah, aanh, aaah..."@>
"Nh, nnh, nfh..."#

{BLOCK:6}
They're indeed female moans.@>
It's hard to tell through the iron door, but I'm sure someone's there.@>
Two girls, at least.@ They're moaning sensually.@>
I'm not sure how accurate my uncle's theory was, but it seems he wasn't too off the mark.@ In all likelihood, they're throwing an orgy there.#

{BLOCK:7}
Mizuho stands frozen in place with a pale face.@ She closes her mouth as if adjusting her resolve, and once again takes a hold of the knob.@>
"I-I'll open it."@>
The atmosphere is tense.@>
I brace myself.@>
I don't know what's behind this door, but if push comes to shove, I have to save Mizuho from any danger.\c
{BG:191010}
\e

{BLOCK:8}
*Click*@>
The knob tilts down with a metallic sound and Mizuho slowly pushes the door.@>
Faint moonlight leaks through the opening.@>
Then, I hear the moans more clearly than before.#

{BLOCK:9}
"Aah...@ Anh, anh...@ Huf..."@>
"Haa...@ Hanh!@ Heeaah..."#

{BLOCK:10}
Upon hearing those sensual moans, Mizuho's expression becomes even more nervous.@>
And there...@>
"!"@>
I'm at a loss for words.@>
Mizuho is frozen with her eyes open wide.@>
Both of us doubt what our eyes are seeing.\c
{BGMFOUT}
{BGMNEXT:13}
{HSCENE:021010}
\e

{BLOCK:11}
The very first thing that catches my eye is the pair of nude girls in the middle of the darkness, whose pale skin stands out inside it.@>
Indecently stark-naked one on top of the other, they skillfully employ their tongues and fingers to fondle their partner's intimate zone.#

{BLOCK:12}
Their seductive moans...@ Their intense fingerplay...@>
Pearl-shaped sweatdrops flow down their limbs as they absorbedly, fervently caress each other.#

{BLOCK:13}
And sitting in a chair there's a man enjoying the show with a smile.@>
It's a bizarre scene indeed.@>
Unconcernedly showing their obscene performance to the man, both girls increase the speed of their fingers, immersing themselves in an even more heated copulation.@>

{BLOCK:14}
Like a couple of irrational animals, they make a moaning, sticky mess of each other as their minds fall into an abyss of sheer pleasure.@>.@>
Slightly amused, the man looks down on them with a cold glare and an emtpy smile.#

{BLOCK:15}
I remember their faces.@>
If I recall correctly, these girls raping each other's genitals with their own hands are...@>
members of the student council.@>
I only glanced briefly at them when I came to visit Mizuho after classes ended, but I have no doubt it's them.@>
Judging by their appearance, I'd have never guessed they'd be able to moan like beasts in heat.#

{BLOCK:16}
All the while the man watches them with an icy stare...@ 
Judging by his position, I figure he's the mastermind behind this, but I know his face.@>
It was just a coincidence, but this afternoon I met him by chance in front of this room when he was with the girls.@>
It's Tsukishima, the former council president who apparently was dating Ohta.#

{BLOCK:17}
The stench of pheromones coming from the room packed full with warm, humid air is floating out to the hallway.@>
We just opened the door and stay standing in front of the girls, but they ignore us and keep assaulting each other without a care in the world.#

{BLOCK:18}
My uncle's hypothesis hit the bull's eye.@>
The late-night meetings were actually happening.@>
Ironically, they're performing these acts in the place where the "superior" students are supposed to gather.#

{BLOCK:19}
The girls reach out their pink-colored tongues, akin to living creatures, and lick every notch of their sexual organs covered in love juices.@>
Their eyes are as unfocused as a dark lake in a moon night.#

{BLOCK:20}
"Y-Yuki...@ Miwako..."@>
Mizuho covers her mouth in disbelief as she whispers their names.@>
"And...@ Tsukishima...?"\c
{CHABG:c41141010}
\e

{BLOCK:21}
Tsukishima, who is sitting in a chair, slowly turns around to us.@>
And then he says with an ice-cold tone:
"Hey, Mizuho.@ Good night."@>
He smiles mischievously.@>
He gives off an ineffable creepiness, enough to make my hair stand on end.@>
Completely overwhelmed, I'm at a loss for words.@ I just stand there frozen in the entrance.\c
{REFCHAR:r26}
\e

{BLOCK:22}
"W-What is all this...?"@>
{CHARA:r29}
Mizuho's voice is trembling.@>
I don't know what to say.@ I just stand there dumbfounded.@>
Even so, they don't seem concerned in the slightest.@>
Still on his chair, Tsukishima smiles relaxedly, while on the other hand the girls continue to crawl over each other.\c
{CHARA:r21}
\e

{BLOCK:23}
"What are you doing?!@ This...@ This is just..."@, Mizuho screams.@ Then, another girl appears from a corner of the gloomy room.@>
The schoolgirl, wearing only a jacket and a pajama, has her face covered in white bandages for whatever reason.@>
It's the girl in casual clothes that entered through the emergency exit before.#

{BLOCK:24}
As soon as Mizuho sees her, she opens wide her eyes behind her glasses.@>
{CHARA:r26}
"K-Kanako..."@>
She calls her name.\c
{CHARA:l31}
\e

{BLOCK:25}
Just as Mizuho said, it's really Ohta.@>
Painful scars are carved on the bits of her cheeks visible in the gaps between the bandages.@>
She scarred her own cheeks with her nails three days ago.@ It hurts just looking at them.#
Those wounds soaked the floor with crimson blood...\c
{REFCHAR:r2A}
\e

{BLOCK:26}
"K-Kanako..."@>
Mizuho's eyes are covered in tears.@>
"Kanako!@ Kanako!"@>
Mizuho runs over to her and embrace her considerably weakened body.@>
"Kanako!@ It's me, Mizuho.@ Do you recognize me?!"@>
However, Ohta doesn't answer in the slightest.#

{BLOCK:27}
Ohta's eyes are just like three days ago.@>
Unfocused like a dark lake under a moon night.@>
The eyes of a broken person...@>
She looks just like a lifeless doll.\c
{REFCHAR:c41}
\e

{BLOCK:28}
"It's useless, Aihara."@>
Tsukishima, who was watching boredly, speaks in a slow tempo.@>
"In her current state not only she can't hear you, she's not even aware of what she's doing."@>
"W-What are you talking about, T-Tsukishima?"@>
Mizuho furrows her brows and opens wide her eyes.#

{BLOCK:29}
"Now she's like a robot that doesn't show interest in anything but sex.@ Hmm, a robot, huh?@ Hahahahaha, that's a great analogy, if I do say so myself.@ Your friend is exactly like a heartless robot."@>
{CHARA:c29}
"W-What are you talking about?"@>
Mizuho's close to crying.@>
{CHARA:c41}
"You know, Aihara?@ I never..."@>
Tsukishima chuckles.@>
"I never liked her from the start."#

{BLOCK:30}
Despite this abnormal situation, Tsukishima's tone voice is quietness incarnate.@>
"She was so annoying.@ I just wanted a toy, that's all."@, Tsukishima says smiling like an innocent kid.@>
{CHARA:c42}
"Slaved toys whose only purpose is to fulfill my sexual desires, that is."\c
{REFCHAR:c99}
\e

{BLOCK:31}
The assitant girls lick each other on the floor.@>
Tsukishima slowly stands up from his chair and crushes under his shoe the abdomen of one of the girls masturbating the other one absent-mindedly on the floor.@>
"Ah, aah, aaaaah!"@>
The girl whose stomach was stomped urinates herself along with a moan of pleasure, and just like that, she reaches the climax.@>
The room fills up with the stench of ammonia.@>
Speechless, we simply gaze at the harrowing scene before us.\c
{CHARA:c42}
\e

{BLOCK:32}
"But, anybody would eventually get tired of using always the same toys, right?@ I already played to my heart's content with her pussies, mouths and assholes, and grew tired of it.@ That's why I thought it's time to discard them."@
Tsukishima tramples on the face of the girl with the sole of his shoe, who looks ecstatic as she drowns in the aftermath of her orgasm.@>
Despite he's stepping on her, she lets out a seductive pant.#

{BLOCK:33}
"As you can see, these girls can't live anymore without my dick.@ Every night they come to milk my semen like bees sucking nectar from flowers."@>
{REFCHAR:c99}
As Tsukishima treads on the elated, exhausted girl, the other girl approaches him crawling.#

{BLOCK:34}
The girl unzips Tsukishima's trousers, and after finding out his penis she takes it out with lovely care, smiling like a baby.#
She holds out her pink tongue, akin to a living creature, and rolls it around his flaccid penis.@ Then, she opens wide her mouth and holds his member into it as if trying to swallow it.@ After that, she keeps sucking his sexual organ wholeheartedly with those unfocused, broken eyes...#
{CHARA:c29}
\e

{BLOCK:35}
"T-This can't be real..."@>
Blushing, Mizuho blinks repeatedly in disbelief.@>
"T-These guys are nuts..."@, I say, and Tsukishima smiles cheerfully.@>
{REFCHAR:c42}
"I'm sane.@ These girls aren't.@ They're so obsessed with sex that they can't let go of me.@ I considered ending them countless times."@>
Tsukishima sighs in resignation.#

{BLOCK:36}
"When I tried to dump Ohta, she came up to my house crying."@>
Tsukishima forcefully pushes away the girl fellating him and walks towards Mizuho.@>
{REFCHAR:c26}
"D-Did you do this horrible thing to Kanako too?"@>
With tears in her eyes, Mizuho glares at Tsukishima.@>
However, Tsukishima doesn't flinch and keeps smiling innocently.\c
{CHARA:c42}
\e

{BLOCK:37}
"Horrible thing?@ I don't know if it was horrible, but we had a lot of sex, that's for sure.@ That's what she asked for, after all."@>
Tsukishima directs his gaze towards Ohta.@>
When Tsukishima looks at her, she smiles happily and reaches out her hands like a kid asking for a toy.\c
{CHARA:c26}
\e

{BLOCK:38}
"No, Kanako, let's go home!@ Let's get out here!@ You can't be in this place!"@>
Mizuho tries desperately to hold back Ohta as she walks towards Tsukishima.@>
{CHARA:c41}
"As you can see, she practically glues to me.@ She was so annoying I had to render her like this."@>
"Like this?@ What do you mean?"@, Mizuho asks holding Ohta tight.#

{BLOCK:39}
"I broke her.@ Her soul, I mean.@ I destroyed her mind so that she doesn't feel pain or jealousy anymore."@>
"You broke her... mind...?"@>
"Yes, using special electromagnetic waves."@>
"Electromagnetic... waves...?"#
