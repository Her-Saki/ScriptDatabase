{BLOCK:0}
Tsukishima's smiling like a kid showing off proudly his toy collection.@>
"I love talking about electromagnetic waves.@ Well, I'm proud of them, after all.@ Do you know about toxic waves, Aihara?"@>
{CHARA:c29}
"P-Please don't joke like that!"@>
Mizuho glares at him.#

{BLOCK:1}
"We'll go home now!@ C'mon, Kanako!"@>
However, despite Mizuho pulls her back, Ohta doesn't move an inch.@>
"P-Please help me, Yuusuke."@>
"O-Okay."@>
I approach both of them and carry Ohta over my shoulder.\c
{CHARA:c41}
\e

{BLOCK:2}
Then, Tsukishima whispers.@>
"You won't ask why she turned out like this?"@>
{CHARA:c2B}
"Huh?!"@>
Mizuho opens wide her eyes and stares at Tsukishima.@>
"Do you know the cause?"@>
{CHARA:c42}
"As I said before, I broke her using toxic waves."\c
{CHARA:c26}
\e

{BLOCK:3}
"Toxic waves?!@ What are you talking about?!@ I don't get it!"@, Mizuho shouts.@>
{CHARA:c42}
"Toxic waves pour down from the sky and drive people crazy.@ As their name suggests, they're literally poisonous electromagnetic waves that make humans act in bizarre ways.@ They're invisible to the eye, and penetrate our brains without us knowing.@ There's no way to block them."#
\e

{BLOCK:4}
Tsukishima keeps talking with a smile.@>
"By nature, human thoughts and feelings are basically an array of electric signals, aren't they?@ The toxic electromagnetic waves have the power of distorting and polluting them.@ Don't you find them fascinating?@ They can twist the mind of a person from outside..."#
"Is that from a TV show you watched or something?!"@>
However, ignoring Mizuho, he keeps chuckling.#

{BLOCK:5}
"Now, what if someone could actually manipulate those toxic waves themselves?@ Don't you think it's an interesting thought experiment?@ That means said person would be able to control other people's mind from afar, as if using a remote control..."#
Tsukishima laughs in amusement.@>
"I can do that!@ I was the one who crushed Ohta's spirit!@ Hahaha!@ I shattered it into pieces!"@>\c
{CHARA:c29}
\e

{BLOCK:6}
"Y-You destroyed it...?@"@, Mizuho says with a trembling voice.@>
{CHARA:c42}
Then, Tsukishima smiles maliciously.@>
"Come, Ohta.@ I'll make you feel good again."@>
{CHARA:c31}
As soon as Tsukishima opens his arms, Ohta smiles happily and shakes off our arms.@>
"!"@>
We were taken by surprise, but it was an amazing strenght.@ She shook off our arms at the same time.#

{BLOCK:7}
Ohta jumps into Tsukishima's arms.@>
{CHARA:c26}
"Wait, Kanako!"@, Mizuho shouts.@>
"It's useless, Aihara.@ She only listens to me now."@>
"Kanako!"@>
It seems Mizuho's desperate appeals don't reach Ohta.#

{BLOCK:8}
"Don't bother trying.@ Your friend is broken.@ She's not the same you once knew.@ Her former self is dead."@>
{CHARA:c29}
"!"@>
Tsukishima's words pierce Mizuho's heart like a blade made of ice.@>
Large tears spill from her large eyes.@>
Stricken with grief and hopelessness, Mizuho hangs her head silently as her slender shoulders quiver.#

{BLOCK:9}
Embraced by Tsukishima, Ohta breaths hard like an animal in heat.@>
He strokes her hair gently.@>
"Huhuhu.@ She's as cute as a pet, isn't she?@ Much more adorable than when she had human emotions."#

{BLOCK:10}
Eventually, Mizuho says in a low voice:@>
{CHARA:c26}
"Kanako...@ Loved you from the bottom of her heart...@ She really loved you..."@>
Tsukishima shakes his head disdainfully.@>
"In the past, Ohta was a stupid girl who tailed me insistently, so I remodeled her brain like this to improve her up a bit.@ However, strangely, she fell for me again.@ I found that amusing, so I decided to play with her for a while more."\c
{CHARA:c23}
\e

{BLOCK:11}
"T-That's horrible!"@>
Tears trickle down Mizuho's cheeks.@>
{CHARA:c21}
"If what you said is true and you made Ohta like this, Tsukishima..."@>
She glares at Tsukishima with a hatred-filled death stare.@>
{CHARA:c26}
"I'LL NEVER FORGIVE YOU!"\c
{CHARA:c99}
\e

{BLOCK:12}
Something hot and unfamiliar rushes up with great momentum from the pit of my stomach.@>
I feel like throwing up.@>
My breathing becomes heavy, my hands and feet tremble, my whole body breaks a sweat.\p\n
My diaphragm convulses.@>
It's like flames erupting inside me.#

{BLOCK:13}
I run towards Tsukishima.@>
{CHARA:c41}
I want to punch him with all my might.@>
Then I'll take Mizuho and Ohta with me and escape.@>
I must flee from this realm of lunacy as soon as possible.\c
{CHARA:c31}
\e

{BLOCK:14}
{PCMLOAD:10}
However, when I'm a step before reaching him, Ohta stands in my way.@>
"!"@>
Our bodies hit against each other.\c
{BGMSTOP}
\e

{BLOCK:15}
{QUAKE}
*Thud!*#

{BLOCK:16}
"Ugh!"@>
{BG2:140910}
{PCMPLAY:0100}
{PCMWAIT}
{PCMSTOP}
{PCMFOUT}
For an instant I didn't quite grasp what was going on, but I floated in the air and then crashed against the wall behind me.@>
The scene that was just reflecting in my eyes a moment ago looks now very distant.@>
Feeling pain creeping up my back, I finally understand.@>
*I* was pushed back.#
{CHARA:c26}
\e

{BLOCK:17}
"Yuusuke!"@>
Mizuho rushes to my side.@>
My ears ring, and I hear her voice fuzzily.@>
I feel dizzy.@>
{REFCHAR:c21}
"Are you okay?!"@>
Supported by Mizuho, I sit up.\c
{REFCHAR:c42}
{BGMPLAY:19}
\e

{BLOCK:18}
I hear Tsukishima giggling.@>
"Humans are animals that set an subconscious limit to their own strenght; a limit which I'm able to remove.@ In their current state, these girls can release their full power unrestrainedly, even if they break their fists or dislocate their shoulders."#

{BLOCK:19}
I have no idea what he's talking about,@>
but it's true that Ohta possess superhuman strenght.@>
I don't stand a chance facing her head to head.@>
I only touched her once, but her might was overwhelming enough to make me understand that immediately.#
{CHARA:c42}
\e

{BLOCK:20}
"Since you're here so late at night, what about you play with us?@ You'll enjoy the time of your lives, I promise."@>
Tsukishima looks down on us with cold eyes.@>
"Stop joking around, please!@ Give Kanako back!"@, Mizuho yells.#

{BLOCK:21}
"Aihara, I think I know why you are with Yuusuke Nagase from class 2-B.@ Nagase, your uncle is the supervisor of this case, isn't he?"@>
No wonder why he's the former president of the student council.@>
Not only he pinpointed accurately my classroom, but he also mentioned my uncle's involvement.#

{BLOCK:22}
"I knew that soon the school management would suspect of us and that they'd send someone to investigate our activities."@>
Tsukishima quietly approaches Mizuho and stops right before her.@>
"But, I couldn't care less.@ Nobody can stop me, after all.@ Anyone who dare to oppose me will have their minds destroyed by my electromagnetic waves."\c
{REFCHAR:c29}
\e

{BLOCK:23}
"Please stop joking around!"@, Mizuho says glaring at Tsukishima.@>
"I'm sick of hearing that!"@>
Tsukishima sighs.@>
{REFCHAR:c42}
"It seems you still don't believe me.@ Alright.@ I'll make you experience plenty of my waves."\c

{FLASH}
*Ba-Bump!*#

{BLOCK:25}
"!"@>
At that moment, my heart rate increases.@>
　
{FLASH}
*Thump!*
{FLASH}
*Thump!*@>
My blood is pumping fiercely through my whole body.@>
Static runs through my head and bites on every bit of it.@>
A physical sensation of electrical particles flowing from the front of my brain to the back assaults me.#

{BLOCK:26}
"Fuah!"@>
At almost the same time, Mizuho's back arches.@>
"U-Uah...@ Aaaah!"@>
Her body twitches as if she received an electric shock and cowers on the floor while holding her head.@>
"Stop, stop, stop!"@, she screams as she shakes and cries in pain.#

{BLOCK:27}
{FLASH}
What's going on?@>
Electric particles travels across my head.@>
{FLASH}
*Bzzzt*@ *Bzzzt*@ *Bzzzt*@ *Bzzzt*@>
It's like an electric current.#

{BLOCK:28}
Are these Tsukishima's toxic waves?@>
Are they penetrating my skull and messing with my brain?@>
Strangely, I feel like a lot of hot THINGS gather inside my body.@>
My skin breaks a sweat and nausea wells up in my throat.@>
A sting of pain runs through my body and my field of vision shakes.\c
{PCMSTOP}
{PCMFOUT}
\e

{BLOCK:29}
The world itself bends like jelly.#

{BLOCK:30}
"Eeeeeek!@ No, no, NOOO!"@, Mizuho screams and cries.@>
It seems she's suffering the same shock as me.@>
"Yeah, I'll make you lose your mind.@ You'll become just like Ohta."@>
His voice echoes loudly in my head.#

{BLOCK:31}
{FLASH}
*Bzzzt*@ *Bzzzt*@ *Bzzzt*@ *Bzzzt*@>
The strange current keeps running.#

{BLOCK:32}
"Yuusuke!@ Yuusuke!"@>
Crying, Mizuho begs desperately for help.@>
{CHABG:c41141010}
Now that I notice, Ohta is staring at Tsukishima with empty eyes.@>
She looks spaced out.\c
{BGMPLAY:20}
\e

{BLOCK:33}
{PCMLOAD:10}
It's now or never!@>
I stand up in a haze and run over to help her, and with great momentum, I push Tsukishima aside.@>
{QUAKE}
{BG2:140910}
"!"@>
{PCMPLAY:0100}
{PCMWAIT}
{PCMSTOP}
{PCMFOUT}
*Thud!*@>
After receiving that sneak push from behind, Tsukishima falls forward.#

{BLOCK:34}
At that instant, the electromagnetic waves stop and the world goes back to normal.@>
"Mizuho!@ Resist!"@>
I pull Mizuho's hand.@>
"K-Kanako,@ Kanako,@ Kanako@, Kanako@, Kanako@, Kanako..."@>
Mizuho cries a river while calling Ohta's name.\c
{ALLCHAR:l35r36c31}
\e

{BLOCK:35}
{PCMLOAD:10}
Ohta and the assistant girls approach us like zombies.@>
"Let's escape!"@>
I embrace Mizuho and pull her out of the room.@>
I don't have time to worry about Ohta.\c

\e

{BLOCK:36}

*Thud!*#

{BLOCK:37}
We trip down in the hallway.@>
"Mizuho!"@>
I stand up and pull Mizuho's hand.@>
"Stand up!"@>
Mizuho stands up unsteadily as teardrops spill from her large eyes.#

{BLOCK:38}
It seems she lost strenght in her legs because she's stumbling.@>
I hold her body between my two hands.@>
{CHARA:c21}
"Y-Yuusuke...@ Please...@ Please save Kanako..."@>
{BGMPLAY:12}
Even in this situation, Mizuho's still worried about Ohta.#

{BLOCK:39}
Slowly, Ohta and the naked girls peek out her faces from the room.@>
{REFCHAR:c26}
"Kanako!"@>
Mizuho calls Ohta.@>
"It's useless!@ Don't bother trying to talk to her now!"@>
{CHARA:c29}
"Ah!"@>
I forcefully pull Mizuho's hand and run through the hallway.\c
{CHARA:c21}
\e

{BLOCK:40}
However, Mizuho shakes off my arm.@>
"Mizuho?!"@>
{CHARA:c2B}
"S-Sorry, but I can't leave with Kanako..."@>
"Mizuho..."@>
Now Mizuho won't move an inch.@>
When it comes to Ohta, she will expose herself to any danger.\c
{ALLCHAR:L35r36c31}
\e

{BLOCK:41}
The girls slowly walk towards the hallway.@>
I'm not exaggerating; I think I really will be killed if they catch me.@>
This is just like a B-tier horror movie.@>
If I were alone, I'd run away immediately without thinking twice.@>
I'm pretty confident in escaping if I run with all my might.#

{BLOCK:42}
However, I can't leave Mizuho here.@>
I have to protect her.#
