{BLOCKLEN:21}

{BLOCK:0}
With staggering, mechanical moves devoid of all liveliness, the three girls circle Mizuho and me.@>
Just as Tsukishima said, they're literally like cold, bloodless robots.@>
Unfocused, their eyes stare at a fixed point in space while their expression doesn't budge an inch.@>
They don't even mutter a single word.#

{BLOCK:1}
Illuminated by the fluorescent lamps of the emergency exit, they look like they're emitting an eerie green aura.@>
Unlike Ohta, the assistant girls are completely naked.@>
Their bare skin and breasts are exposed, and they don't even try to hide their intimate body parts.@>
These schoolgirls forgot even their shame.@>
Despite their pale, naked bodies are in front of me, I don't feel the slightest arousal.@>
They're creepy.@>
That's all I think about them.#

{BLOCK:2}
Since they lost their hearts, they wouldn't probably feel tormented after killing a person with their own hands.@>
That's what I feel.@>
I might get killed...@>
That sentence dominates me with fear.#

{BLOCK:3}
Despite we're close to spring, a wind similar to opening a refrigerator blows, freezing my spine.@>
I'm trembling and losing strenght in my legs.@>
Now I can't leave Mizuho behind and run away anymore.#

{BLOCK:4}
Mizuho stands before me.@>
{REFCHAR:c2A}
"Yuki, Miwako, stop it already."@>
Despite Mizuho has tears in her eyes, she manages to crack a stiff smile and talk to the naked girls.#

{BLOCK:5}
"Yuki, you guys are just poking fun at me as always, right?@ You're going to laugh and tell me this is all a joke, aren't you?"@>
Mizuho's words sound like wishful thinking instead of confidence.@>
However, as if her voice fell on deaf ears, the short-haired girl doesn't show the slightest response.#

{BLOCK:6}
Now Mizuho faces the girl with braids.@>
{CHARA:c21}
"Miwako, you're still the same gentle Miwako as always, right?@ You're just playing along with Yuki, am I wrong?"@>
She's unresponsive as well.\c
{CHARA:c2A}
\e

{BLOCK:7}
"Kanako, let's go home already."@, Mizuho says in front of Ohta.@>
"Let's go back to the hospital, okay?@ Your mom is worried about you.@ C'mon, Kanako...@ Kanako..."@>
Mizuho grabs Ohta's arm and calls her name desperately.@>
Nonetheless, Ohta keeps being expressionles and doesn't exhibit even a minimal reaction.@>

{BLOCK:8}
The three girls have similar eyes.@>
Like a sticky, dark, polluted swamp.@>
The same eyes Ohta had that day.@>
The eyes of a broken person.@>
The eyes of someone who thinks little about killing a person.@>
{CHARA:c29}
"This is all a joke, isn't it, girls?"@>
Mizuho's slim shoulders quiver.\c
{CHARA:c41}
\e

{BLOCK:9}
"Wow, you guys didn't escape?@ Bravo."@>
Tsukishima appears after them.@>
"Are you so worried about your friends?@ Huhuhu, in that case, you might as well join them.@ I'm gonna make you enjoy a pleasant dream just like I did with them."@>
{BGMFOUT}
{BGMWAIT}
{BGMPLAY:21}
{REFCHAR:c29}
"Tsukishima!"@>
Mizuho glares at him with hatred.@>
Tsukishima chuckles innocently.\c
{REFCHAR:c99}
\e

{BLOCK:10}
"C'mon, girls, make those two your new playmates."@>
{ALLCHAR:r36l35c99}
When Tsukishima issues said order, the pair of naked girls approach Mizuho and grab her slender arms.@>
{REFCHAR:c26}
"S-Stop, let me go!@ Yuki, Miwako!"@>
Mizuho struggles, but the girls pin her down very easily with their incredible strenght.@ No man would be a match for them.\c
{REFCHAR:r99}
\e

{BLOCK:11}
"M-Mizuho!"@>
I cross Ohta by who is standing before me and run towards Mizuho,@>
but then...\c
{BGMSTOP}
\e

{BLOCK:12}
{QUAKE}
*Blam!*\c
{BG:081010}
\e

{BLOCK:13}
I feel a heavy impact in the back of my head.@>
Ohta hit my nape strongly with her clenched fist.@>
I lose consciousness at an alarming speed.#

{BLOCK:14}
I might be killed.@>
I hear my own voice inside my head.@>
That's true.@>
I'm going to die.\c
{BGMPLAY:01}
\e

{BLOCK:15}
Why?@>
What did I do to deserve this?@>
I don't understand.@>
There's no reason for me to die...@>
--Reason?@>
Oh, I know.@>
There IS a reason.#

{BLOCK:16}
People who you can't tell if they're alive or dead should die at once.@>
That's my pet theory.@>
In that case, of course, I must die first than anybody else.@>
I'm one of them, after all.#

{BLOCK:17}
Up until now, all I did was escaping from everything.@>
I didn't want to get hurt, so I didn't try to make friends.@>
I hated challenges that involved winning or losing, so I didn't compete with anyone.@>
The fear of paying the price to achieve something prevented me from making efforts towards it.#

{BLOCK:18}
I was nothing but a breathing lump of flesh.@>
To begin with, I had no reason to exist in this world.#
I was always running away, so I felt...@>
that the world didn't need a coward like me.@>
The world would lose nothing with my death.#

{BLOCK:19}
That's right.@>
I have plenty of reason to be dead.@>
Strangely, I convince myself of that and lose all strenght in my body.#

{BLOCK:20}
Eventually, I'm absorbed by a darkness akin to sticky, pitch-black tar.\c
