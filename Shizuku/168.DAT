These three girls with inhuman strength are controlled by Tsukishima.@>
If we do something about him, maybe we could stand a chance.@>
We have to do defeat him first.#

{BLOCK:1}
My whole body feels dull.@>
Both of my legs are staggering.@>
But eve so, I stand up.@>
{CHARA:c41}
Tsukishima is before me.@ He's laughing while observing Mizuho's shameful figure.@>
He's not paying attention to me.#

{BLOCK:2}
{PCMLOAD:10}
"Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!"@>
I kick the floor and break out running.@>
{CHARA:c44}
"!"@>
Before I realize it, I'm howling.@>
I clench my right fist so hard that it bleeds and punch Tsukishima in the face with every ounce of my body behind.@>
{QUAKE}
{REFCHAR:c99}
Tsukishima's body twists flashily and gets slammed against the wall behind him.\c

{BLOCK:3}
My mind goes blank.@>
The impulse of erradicating this horrible creature is pushing me on.#

{BLOCK:4}
{PCMLOAD:10}
"Woooooh!"@>
When I'm about to deliver my next punch, a white figure stands before me.@>
{CHARA:c36}
It's Yuki.#

{BLOCK:5}
{QUAKE}
*Whump!*@>
{BG:080910}
{PCMPLAY:0100}
{PCMWAIT}
{PCMSTOP}
"!"@>
Yuki's fist delves deep into my stomach.@ I bend my body downwards and cower on the floor.#

{BLOCK:6}
{QUAKE}
*Bam!*@>
"Gah!"@>
Without giving me room to breath, she drops a shoulder onto my back.@>
I go down on my knees.#

{BLOCK:7}
{QUAKE}
*Pow!*@>
Yuki follows her attack kicking me right in the face.@>
The world spins 180Â° and my body floats in the air.@>
{BG:500610}
{PCMPLAY:0100}
{PCMWAIT}
{PCMSTOP}
{PCMFOUT}
*Whomp!*@>
I fall on my face to the floor.@>
"Kgah!"@>
That back blow left me out of breath.@>
Gasping for air, I try desperately to put my lungs into motion.#

{BLOCK:8}
"Y-Yuusuke..."@>
I hear Mizuho's frail voice as if it came from very far away.@>
Protected by stark-naked Yuki, Tsukishima stands up as he holds his cheek and a curly smile cracks on his face.@>
{CHARA:c46}
"A sneak attack?@ My, aren't you a bad boy..."#

{BLOCK:9}
{REFCHAR:c36}
Yuki walks towards me.@>
Her well-formed pale breasts sway in front of me.@>
While I'm on the floor, Yuki grabs my shoulders, makes me stand up by force and strikes my solar plexus with her knee.@>
{QUAKE}
{BG:080910}
The dull impact thrust up to my back and my body arches.@>
"Gah..."@>
Gastric juice wells up and I vomit.@>
That filthy mass splashes onto Yuki's pale thighs.#

{BLOCK:10}
{QUAKE}
*Thud!*@>
An impact runs through the back of my head.@>
Yuki hit me from behind.@>
I feel like the entire world is shaking.@>
The scene before my eyes fades to black.#

{BLOCK:11}
And then, I lose consciousness.\c
