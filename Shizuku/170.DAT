Perhaps because it broke, the sound of the music box stops and once again silence reigns over the place.@>
I wipe the blood off my nose and walk once more towards Mizuho.@>
{CHARA:c32}
Ohta stands between us as if blocking my way.@>
Mizuho is right behind her.\c

{BLOCK:1}
"Move."@>
I say, and put myself on guard.#

{BLOCK:2}
Nothing I tell her will have any effect.@>
I've been aware of that way before this.@>
But, I don't care if it's useless.@>
I just don't want to run away anymore.@>
I'm sick of escaping from everything just because it's scary or painful.#

{BLOCK:3}
"Didn't you hear me?@ Move."@>
I repeat.@>
Ohta looks at me with the eyes of an automaton.@>
I ignore her and walk past her.#

{BLOCK:4}
*WHAM!*@>
{QUAKE}
{BG:080505}
I take a ridiculously powerful impact that goes from my solar plexus to my back.@>
When I look down, I see Ohta's left fist piercing my stomach.@>
I feel something acid welling up in my throat, and then vomit.@>
Messy puke stains Ohta's arm.#

{BLOCK:5}
*TWACK!*@>
{QUAKE}
Next thing I know, I feel an impact in the back of my head.@>
Ohta hit me from behind.@>
I feel the world shakes violently, and my field of sight turns pitch-black.#

{BLOCK:6}
"Yuu... suke..."@>
Just before I faint out of this reality, I hear Mizuho's anguished voice.#

{BLOCK:7}
And finally, I pass out.\c
