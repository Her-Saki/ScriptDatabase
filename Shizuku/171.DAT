"K-Kanako..."@>
Mizuho stands up unsteadily and calls Ohta's name.@>
Ohta drops the extinguisher she was holding and turns around to Mizuho with her typical empty gaze.@>
She moves like a rusty machine.#

{BLOCK:1}
"Kanako?"@>
Mizuho whispers her name one more time.@>
"It's me, Mizuho.@ Do you know who I am, right, Kanako?"@>
Her voice is gentle, as if she was dealing with a little kid.@>
"Kanako...@ Hey, Kanako!"#

{BLOCK:2}
Ohta stares at Mizuho with an unfocused gaze,@>
and then, she moves her lips just a tiny bit.@>
"Mizu...@ ho..."@>
"Huh?!"@>
Her voice is monotonous and barely audible, but right now she certainly mentioned Mizuho's name.\c
{VISUAL:131010}
\e

{BLOCK:3}
"K-Kanako?@ Do you... recognize me?"@>
Mizuho approaches Ohta walking clumsily.@>
Then, she grabs both of Ohta's arms and peeks at her face.#

{BLOCK:4}
"Kanako?"@, she mutters,@>
and then,@>
something shines near Ohta's cheek.@>
A teardrop spills from her distant, dormant eyes and trickles down her cheek.#

{BLOCK:5}
The teardrop reflects the moonlight coming from the window like a jewel.@>
"K-Kanako..."@>
"Mizu... ho..."@>
She calls Mizuho's name again as she stares at the space.#

{BLOCK:6}
"W-What?@ Kanako?!"@>
"Mizu... ho...@ I'm... sorry..."@>
"K-Kana...@ Kanako..."@>
Mizuho's eyes dampen with tears.#

{BLOCK:7}
"Mizuho...@ I'm... sorry...@ Mizuho...@ I'm... sorry..."@, Ohta repeats.@>
"Don't worry about that, Kanako..."@>
Mizuho's eyes overflow with large tears.#

{BLOCK:8}
"You don't have to apologize.@ As long as you return to your usual self, I'll be fine whatever happens to me."@>
Shedding tears while smiling, Mizuho sinks her face into Ohta's chest and breaks down cyring.#

{BLOCK:9}
"Mizuho...@ I'm sorry...@ Mizuho...@ I'm sorry...@ Mizuho...@ I'm sorry...@ Mizuho...@ I'm sorry..."@, Ohta repeats as she strokes gently Mizuho's hair.@>

{BLOCK:10}
"Mizuho...@ I'm sorry...@ Mizuho...@ I'm sorry...@ Mizuho...@ I'm sorry...@ Mizuho...@ I'm sorry...@ Mizuho...@ I'm sorry..."@, Ohta repeats endlessly like a music box playing a sad melody.\c

{BLOCK:12}
Like a painting, yellow moonlight shines faintly on the world below.@>
Upon contact with the chilly air, my body trembles.#

{BLOCK:13}
Every day of my life was filled with boredom and tedium.@>
I felt hopelessly alone and I lost track of the purpose of my existence.@>
That heart-crushing meaninglessness I felt towards living made me depressed and hurt.@>
This stupid world lost all color and I closed my ears to the noise around me.@>
Before I realized it, I found myself living all alone in a colorless, mute film.#

{BLOCK:14}
I was a small flame burning atop a slender candle, so feeble that it could be blown away from the world with the slightest breeze.@>
I was about to disappear.\c
{BG:150303}
\e

{BLOCK:15}
However, despite being like that, there was something that provided me with fervent, sticky, blood-pumping excitement as well as fiery, electrifying euphoria.@>
That was...@ fantasies.@>
Whenever I fantasized about the apocalypsis, even if only for a little while, I became strongly aware of my own existence.@>
That was the only place where I could be myself.#

{BLOCK:16}
Reality lost its color and sound at an alarming speed, while on the contrary, delusions became more vivid every passing day.@>
After repeating such deliriums for a long time, I eventually became unable to tell apart fantasy from reality.@>
{BG:110303}
\e

{BLOCK:17}
Around that time the door of insanity came into view for me.@>
I always knew it'd appear at some point.@>
If only I could reach that door and open it, I could say goodbye to this lonely world.@>
Beyond that gate, an endless world of drug-like pleasure was waiting for me...#

{BLOCK:18}
That's why, in all honesty, I felt jealous of Ohta when she became possessed by insanity.@>
"I want to open the door soon too", I thought.#

{BLOCK:19}
I wanted to travel to that sticky, pulpy, yet bright and energetic world as soon as possible.@>

{BLOCK:20}
I wished to leave for that eternal dream,@>
for that world of madness...\c

{BLOCK:21}
The ambulance came in a rush.\c
{BG:500808}
\e

{BLOCK:22}
I guide the stretcher up to the student council room, and there, Ohta is hugging Tsukishima.@>
{VISUAL:201010}
{BGMPLAY:22}
With those unfocused eyes of hers, she's leaning her face against his chest.#

{BLOCK:23}
Under the moonlight, they look just like a piece of art under a spotlight.#

{BLOCK:24}
At a certain moment, a little piece fell off a machine.@>
Perhaps it was irrelevant or maybe it had some kind of importance, but regardless, it had a small effect on a cogwheel.#

{BLOCK:25}
That cogwheel affected another one, and that one disturbed another one, and so on and so forth, until eventually, that chain of accidents ended up altering the spin of a major gear.@>
And at the end of that chain...#

{BLOCK:26}
In the end, everyone became unhappy.#

{BLOCK:27}
It doesn't matter who is to blame or what was the trigger that started it all.@>
The only thing I'm absolutely certain of is that THIS is how people who yield to madness end up as.@>
In the world of insanity there's no rest nor pleasure.@>
What lies beyond its path is nothing but destruction.#

{BLOCK:28}
As I look at them before me, I hear a sound.\n
It's the sound of the door of insanity closing up.@>
This also implies the collapse of the values I held up until now.#

{BLOCK:29}
Until they carry Tsukishima out on the stretcher, Ohta keeps leaning her cheek against his chest and looking at him vacantly.@>
Given her usual expressionlessness, she didn't show anything resembling an emotion, yet for some reason, to my eyes she looked like she was crying uncontrollably.\c

{BLOCK:31}
Morning classes end and we're now in break time.@>
Everybody in the classroom hurries to arrange their seats and start eating their lunches.@>
A foreign song plays through the speaker, but the chit-chat of the students overlaps it off.#

{BLOCK:32}
This is a scene I'm very used to see.#

{BLOCK:33}
Several days have passed since then, and I came back to this stupid world once again.@>
Now that things have calmed down, I remember that insane night as a distant past event.@>
As I listen to the bustling crowd, I wonder if what I experienced that night was real or just a byproduct of my fantasies.#

{BLOCK:34}
My life hasn't changed in the slightest.@>
I get up, come to school, and then sleep; rinse and repeat every day.@>
I'm just walking in circles, repeating the same cycle every single day.#

{BLOCK:35}
However, some people couldn't come back to that cycle.#

{BLOCK:36}
Yuki Yoshida and Miwako Katsuragi, the student council assitants...@>
Takuya Tsukishima, the former student council president...@>
and... Kanako Ohta.#

{BLOCK:37}
I wonder if the girls will eventually come back to this daily life...#

{BLOCK:38}
After they took Tsukishima in the ambulance, I told everything I saw about the incident to my uncle.@>
My uncle came immediately with the other teachers and took Ohta and her friends to a nearby general hospital.@>
Mizuho and I were sent home under the pretext of lateness.#

{BLOCK:39}
The day next, my uncle told me about what happened to the girls.@>
After arriving to the hospital, Tsukishima escaped death by a hair's breadth, but due to his cerebral contusion he hasn't recovered consciousness and, if not careful, he might turn a vegetable.#

{BLOCK:40}
The three girls were transferred from a general hospital to a psych ward.@>
Later, I went there along with Mizuho, but they didn't allow third-party visits and we were immediately expelled.@>
According to some students, they're beyond all hope of recovery, but Mizuho has no doubts they'll eventually get better.#

{BLOCK:41}
After that, Mizuho and I were questioned by the police quite a number of times.@>
Of course, nobody believed the existence of electromagnetic waves, and the case was written off (rather ambiguously) as an episode of mass delusion.@>
Unable to do anything about it, I cut ties with the case right there.#

{BLOCK:42}
I look outside the window, and there, a wide blue sky spreads out everywhere.@>
I hate this tiresome, dull, deadly boring, mind-blowingly stupid, puke-inducing daily life with every fiber of my being.#

{BLOCK:43}
However... here I can enjoy true peace.#

{BLOCK:44}
Yeah... That's right.#

{BLOCK:45}
I was always surrounded by this warm peace.@>
That's exactly why I lost sight of it.@>
Of this world's gentleness, warmth...@>
Perhaps I was just being an immature edgy kid trying to rebel against this peaceful, secure world.\c

{BLOCK:46}
I stand up from my seat and head towards the rooftop, just like yesterday.\c
{BG:310707}
\e

{BLOCK:47}
A pleasant breeze blows in the rooftop.@>
The bright rays of sun shine all over the place.@>
Surrounded by the fine sunlight of spring, I can feel it in the air that it is approaching.\c
{CHABG:r24340707}
{BGMPLAY:06}
\e

{BLOCK:48}
And just like yesterday, Mizuho's here.@>
"You here again?"@>, I say, and Mizuho slowly turns around to me.@>
{CHARA:r20}
Her eyes are full of tears.#

{BLOCK:49}
Mizuho looks at me and quickly wipes her tears.@>
{CHARA:r2A}
"I had some dust in my eye.@ It seems the wind is strong today..."@, she says smiling sweetly.@>
I realize immediately that she's lying.#

{BLOCK:50}
Since that day, Mizuho comes here every lunch break and stares at the landscape absent-mindedly.@>
She remembers when she used to have lunch with Ohta here, and when nobody sees her, she cries in solitude.#

{BLOCK:51}
"Today's a fine day, isn't it?"@>
Mizuho tries her best to crack up a smile.@>
"Has break ended yet?"@>
Unusual of her, she keeps the conversation going before I do.@>
I think she'll break down crying as soon as she stops talking.#

{BLOCK:52}
"No, not yet."@>
"It feels nice to eat in the rooftop in days like these.@ I used to lunch with Kanako here..."\c
{CHARA:r23}
\e

{BLOCK:53}
*Drip*@>
In response to mentioning Ohta's name, a teardrop spills from Mizuho's eye.@>
"H-Huh?@ This is weird..."@>
Mizuho wipes her eyes.@>
Every time she does, however, more tears overflow.#

{BLOCK:54}
A plethora of teardrops trickle down her cheeks.@>
"I-I still...@ h-have dust..."@>
Mizuho weeps unable to talk properly.\c
{BGMNEXT:22}

{VISUAL:191010}
\e

{BLOCK:55}
"Don't worry anymore, Mizuho.@ You've had enough..."@>
I softly embrace Mizuho by the shoulders.@>
With her eyes full of tears, Mizuho forces herself to smile and looks at me.@>
She looks very brave as she tries with all her might to put on a smile.#

{BLOCK:56}
"Yuusuke, I...@ I know I promised yesterday that I wouldn't cry, and yet..."@>
Mizuho's tears flow down like a downpour.@>
"S-Sorry...@ I...@ I don't think I can't hold that p-promise..."@>
Mizuho rests her face against my chest and cries her eyes away.#

{BLOCK:57}
"Mizuho..."@>
I gently stroke her hair.@>
"She recovered her heart once, so I'm sure she'll eventually go back to normal."@>
"Uuh, Yuusuke!@ Yuusukeee..."@>
Mizuho keeps shedding teardrops.@>
As the world is enveloped in pure white light, I strongly embrace Mizuho.\c
{BGMFOUT}
{BGMWAIT}
{VISUAL:220505}
\e

{BLOCK:58}
A breeze blows upwards making her hair and uniform flutter.@>
The shadow of a plane traversing the sky crosses the courtyard and engulfs us as we stand in the rooftop.@>
After the shadow passes through, the sunlight shines upon us again.#

{BLOCK:59}
Surrounded by sunlight, our shadows become one.@>
And so, under the rays of the sun, we feel each other's warmth.#
