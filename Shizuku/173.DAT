{BLOCK:0}
I just keep scribbling my notebook absent-mindedly.@>
These strange lines I just drew have no meaning at all.@>
My hand is moving on its own, that's all.#

{BLOCK:1}
I let my imagination fly.@>
I fantasize about making friends with a certain girl.\c
{BGMFOUT}
{BGMWAIT}
{BGMPLAY:01}
{CHARA:r33}
\e

{BLOCK:2}
Kanako Ohta.@>
That's her name.@>
I throw a glance at her seat placed diagonally to mine.@>
There is she writing silently with her pen on her notebook.#

{BLOCK:3}
She's the vice president of the student council.@>
She's beautiful, adorable, bright, optimistic, and well-liked by both boys and girls.@>
During breaks she's always surrounded by people.@>
She has a lots of friends; a world of difference compared to me with my gloomy personality and delusion fetish.#

{BLOCK:4}
However, it seems I've fallen in love with her of all people.@>
I found about it just recently.@>
There wasn't any trigger in particular.@>
One day, all of a sudden, I fell for her.#

{BLOCK:5}
At first I was just merely interested in her.@>
Nonetheless, those feelings grew stronger every day and I started to keep a serious eye on her.@>
My heart beat fast and my chest hurt as if someone was crushing me from inside.@>
Rage boiled inside me whenever I saw her talking amicably with other boys...@ Yeah, I even developed such jealousy feelings.@>
She was the only person in my mind whenever I closed my eyes.@ Before I realized it, I found myself madly in love with her.#

{BLOCK:6}
To be honest, this is just a one-sided love.@>
I have too many rivals.@>
If we talk about masculine appeal, my only specialty is delusions, and given my dark-natured personality, I'm pretty sure I sit very low in her rank.@>
I'm completely off her radar, and I'm fully aware of that.@>

{BLOCK:7}
For starters, I've never even talked to her.@>
I'm year round immsersing myself in delusions; forget about talking with girls, I don't even have male friends.@>
I'm not even sure if she knows I exist.#

{BLOCK:8}
But even so, I like her and there's nothing I can do about it.@>
My feelings for her won't change.@>
That's why I satisfy my heart dreaming about an impossible romance with her.@>
My classmates are gradually drifting apart from me, but instead of attempting to make friends with them, I'd rather foster a platonic love with Kanako.@ That's much more fun.\c

\e

{BLOCK:9}
In my fantasy, she only has eyes for me and loves only me.@>
After all, in this ideal world only the two of us exist.@>
We're completely alone.\c
{CHABG:r33110505}
\e

{BLOCK:10}
Of course, we're also alone at night.@>
She's afraid of quiet nights, so every night she trembles like a kitty.@>
I embrace her gently by the shoulders, and then she calms down until eventually she falls asleep peacefully.\c
{CHABG:r33340505}
\e

{BLOCK:11}
We're alone during mornings as well.@>
She wakes me up with a sweet voice.@>
Later, she prepares a table with a lot of breakfast just for me.\c
{CHABG:r33420505}
\e

{BLOCK:12}
We're alone in the afternoons too.@>
Joining hands, we run through the sunny spots below the trees.@>
After running out of breath, a gentle breeze envelops us as we rest under a big tree.@>
I use her lap as a pillow.\c
{CHABG:r33430505}
\e

{BLOCK:13}
Of course, we're alone at nightfall as well.@>
We dinner on a table full of dishes and cheer with glasses of wine.@>
We bring our faces close to each other and exchange a kiss.\c
{CHABG:r33270505}
\e

{BLOCK:14}
While she's always my platonic girlfriend, I often imagine her as a lustful sexual slave, or as a gentle mother, etc.@>
That night where we smiled to each other under the radiant rays of the sun we copulated like animals, and the next morning I woke up to the delicious smell of home-made breakfast.\c
{CHABG:r33010505}
\e

{BLOCK:15}
Aside from us, in this world every other human is unnecessary.@>
Everybody who stands in our way should just disappear.@>
If that happened, this fantasy would become true.@>
If everyone were gone...\c

{BG:040000}
\e

{BLOCK:16}
As I dive into such fantasies through the day, school ends.@ Every day is like this.@>
The real Ohta never gives me the time of day, but the Ohta of my dreams loves only me, so I don't feel lonely.@>
I've started to practice escapism.@>
Despite I'm all alone in the real world, I'm always with Ohta inside my fantasies.\c
{BGMFOUT}
{BGMWAIT}
{BG:000011}
\e

{BLOCK:17}
Then one day...@ This happened.\c
{BG:241101}
{BGMPLAY:02}
\e

{BLOCK:18}
It happened during P.E class.@>
We were running and jumping in the second gym for a test.@>
"Next!"@>
Every time the teacher blows their whistle, the students run with all their might and jump over me.@>

{BLOCK:19}
As soon as my turn ends, I quickly grab my knees and start fantasizing.@>
I project the jumping session in loop.@>
Just as if I counted sheeps, I quickly fall asleep.#

{BLOCK:20}
When the teacher calls his name, Ito breaks sprinting.@>
I start imagining as I observe that silent, colorless film.@>
Ito kicks the floor vigorously and jumps over the bar.\c
{BGMFOUT}
{BGMWAIT}
\e

{BLOCK:21}
And then...@>
he disappears.#

{BLOCK:22}
"!"@>
I blink repeatedly and stare fixedly at the mat.@>
However, Ito's not there anymore.@>
He kicked the floor and jumped over the bar, but disappeared mid-air before landing on the mat.@>
--Or at least that's how it looked to me.\c
{BGMPLAY:09}
\e

{BLOCK:23}
I rub my eyes and check the scene once again, but naturally, Ito isn't there.#

{BLOCK:24}
"H-Hey, that guy that jumped before..."@>
I talk to Tanaka right next to me.@>
"Where did Ito go?!"@>
Tanaka looks at me in confusion, and then he says:@>
"Ito?@ Who's that?"#

{BLOCK:25}
"I-Ito, for fuck's sake..."@>
Tanaka laughs while staring at me.@>
"He jumped and disappeared mid-air!"#

{BLOCK:26}
"Next!"@>
*Peeep!*@>
Now Suzuki jumps and also disappears.#

{BLOCK:27}
"This time Suzuki is gone!"@>
I scream to Tanaka.@>
"C'mon now, Nagase.@ First "Ito", now "Suzuki"...@ Who the hell are you talking about?"@>
"Ito and Suzuki, goddammit!@ They're our classmates!"@>
"Hey, you trying to be funny or something?"@>
"Both of them puffed out while jumping!"@>
"T-The fuck you on about?"#

{BLOCK:28}
"Next!"@>
*Peeep!@>
They blow the whistle.@>
This time Nakazawa runs.@>
"Look!@ Look at him while he jumps!"@, I scream pointing to the mat.@>
Tanaka directs his gaze to where I point out.#

{BLOCK:29}
Nakazawa jumps...@>
and then disappears.#

{BLOCK:30}
"Did you see that?!@ He's GONE!"@>
I say looking to the side, but Tanaka is not there.#

{BLOCK:31}
"!"@>
Not only Tanaka.@>
Sadamoto, Nagai, Nishimura...@ Everybody next to me is gone.@>
The P.E. teacher also disappeared.#

{BLOCK:32}
What's going on?!@>
What the hell is happening here?!@>
The gym is completely silent.\c
{BG:100202}
\e

{BLOCK:33}
Not only the boys disappeared.@>
There's nobody in the classrooms and the staff room.@>
Everybody in school has been wiped off the face of Earth.@>
"No way..."@>
I leap out of school.\c
{BG:000011}
\e

{BLOCK:34}
Not only it happened in school.@>
Everybody in the shopping district, streets and the city overall disappeared.@>
The fast food chains and the convenience stores, too, are open but completely empty.@>
"Is there anybody home?!"@>
I shout, but nobody answers.#

{BLOCK:35}
For some reason, everybody in this city...@ No, perhaps in the entire world, disappeared.#

{BLOCK:36}
This...@>
This is just like...@>
the fantasy I had.\c
{BGMFOUT}
{BGMWAIT}
{BGMPLAY:05}
\e

{BLOCK:37}
--Fantasy?@>
Of course, this is just a fantasy.@>
I suddenly realize...@>
that this might just be a byproduct of my imagination.@>
I entered the world of delusions and can't get out.#

{BLOCK:38}
That means...@>
that Ohta should be here.@>
I run as soon as that clicks in my mind.@>
My destination is the school.@>
Ohta must be there.\c
{BGMFOUT}
{BGMWAIT}
{CHABG:r33020606}
{BGMPLAY:03}
\e

{BLOCK:39}
"Nagase..."@>
After I return to my classroom, naturally, she's there to receive me.#

{BLOCK:40}
I don't know if "naturally" is the correct word, but anyway, there's no doubt this is my world of fantasy.@>
Yes, this is our exclusive world.#

{BLOCK:41}
After that, we spent some time alone for a while.@>
She relies on me and I try my best to answer her.@>
Everything goes just as I imagine.@>
The only difference (which I realized later) is that this is not the realm where my delusions usually take place.\c
{BGMFOUT}
{BGMWAIT}
{BG:000011}
\e

{BLOCK:42}
We keep living in our world for three days more when something happens...\c
{BG:341100}
{BGMPLAY:01}
\e

{BLOCK:43}
After kissing in the school's rooftop, we gaze at the empty city.@>
Then, as she scoops up her hair, she says:\c
{CHARA:r33}
\e

{BLOCK:44}
"Y'know,@ I've been in love with you from long ago."@>
"Huh?"@>
"Way before now I was a mediocre, dark-natured girl.@ I performed poorly academically and in sports, and since I'm not exactly a beauty, I had zero popularity among the boys."@>
"W-What are you talking about?"#

{BLOCK:45}
"Back then I had the habit of "wishing"."@>
"Wishing?"@>
She nods.@>
"Every day I wished to become pretty, to become cheerful, to be popular with the boys..."@>
She smiles sweetly.#

{BLOCK:46}
"And then, one day, that wish became true."@>
"It was fulfilled?"@>
"Yes!@ One day, I suddenly became a beauty and had a lot of boyfriends.@ However, nobody noticed I changed.@ Everybody thought I was like that from the start.@ That's what I wished for, after all."#

{BLOCK:47}
She sighs and keeps going.@>
"Since then, my every wish became true and I dated a lot of cool guys.@ But, soon after I got bored of them."@>
"You got bored?"@>
She chuckles.@>
"They were good-looking and nothing else.@ Generic.@ Like, they lacked spice, the "fun" factor."@>
"So they were boring?"#

{BLOCK:48}
"Yeah, exactly."@, she says, bringing her face close to mine.@>
"And...@ since you reminded me so much of my old self, I fell for you for real."@>
"Huh?"@>
"That's why I wished for you to like me."@>
Ohta smiles misteriously.@>
That's the smile of a queen that controls everything in the world.#

{BLOCK:49}
If what she said is true...@>
Then my feelings for her are a byproduct of her wish?!#

{BLOCK:50}
"But..."@>
She keeps going.@>
"You never fell in love with me.@ Like, not even the slightest sign of it."@>
No!@>, I was about to scream, but I keep silent.@>
Perhaps even this feeling is part of her wish.#

{BLOCK:51}
"You were always spacing out so I thought my wish didn't come true.@ That's why I wished for this world to be only ours instead."@>
"What?@ Then you created this world?!"@>
"Huhuhu.@ Relax.@ I can revert it if I wish to do so again.@ So, let's enjoy this."@>
She chuckles like a little devil.#

{BLOCK:52}
{PCMLOAD:11}
I just stare at her dumbfounded.@>
"So..."@, she says leaning against the fence.\c
{BGMFOUT}
{BGMWAIT}
\e

{BLOCK:53}
*Thud!*@>
{QUAKE}
Suddenly, the fence slides off.\c
{CHARA:r99}

{BG:000011}
\e

{BLOCK:55}
Ohta falls upside down from the rooftop.@>
I run towards the broken fence and quickly peek downwards.@>
The ground below is covered in blood and, in the middle, Ohta lies immobile.\c
{PCMLOAD:01}
\e

{BLOCK:56}
{PCMPLAY:0100}
*Whoooosh...*@>
A cold breeze blows through the rooftop.\c
{PCMWAIT}

\e

{BLOCK:57}
I'm now all alone...@ quite literally.#
