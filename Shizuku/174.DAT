{BGMPLAY:19}
Now, what will I fantasize about today?@>
I'm tired of stand-of-the-mill fancies.@>
Naturally, since my special skill is "delusions", I'm able to imagine a lot of diverse scenarios.#

{BLOCK:1}
Alright, I got it.@>
Well, actually, the player decided it with a multiple choice.@>
Today I will simulate a war against the dimensionalings.@>
I can't go against the player's wishes.@>
If they chose "fight against the dimensionalings" and then I took a completely different path...@>
I bet they'd get angry.#

{BLOCK:2}
I bet there are people that would find that cool tough.@>
However, a mold-breaking narrative may not necessarily bring good results.@>
For starters, I'm a good-natured guy who follows obediently the will of the player.@>
I'm basically a clone of them.@>
I'd never be ungrateful to my master.@>
(That said, it feels kinda like I'm doing a favor to them and then demanding a reward...)#

{BLOCK:3}
I start fantasizing.@>
Since this a simulated war, any unnecesary scene will be cut.@>
I'll begin imagining the fights at once.#

{BLOCK:4}
When you think about dimensional beings, the very first thing that pops in your mind are the Ya*ool, right?@>
They're the nemesis of Ultr*man A, the kind of enemies that appear blurred along with a wavy scroll effect.@>
Compared to them, the Podre*ms from Win*man are nothing but minor entities.@>
That's why I decided these enemies to be designed like Ya*ools.#

{BLOCK:5}
*Bee-Beeem!*@>
Out of the blue, a dimensionaling pops out and fires lasers from its eyes.@>
It's a very sudden turn of events, and impactful enough as the outset of the story.#

{BLOCK:6}
{FLASH}
{QUAKE}
These strange rays of light instantly burn Tanaka (temporary name) sitting next to me to death.@>
Oh my god!@>
A character has died already!@>
Yeah, this also feels impactful enough.#

{BLOCK:7}
Now that I remember, Tanaka showed me his "pendant with a photo of his girlfriend" a while ago.@>
And then he said smiling:@>
"We'll marry soon."@>
Once you throw a one-liner like that, you're toast.@>
You have to die.@>
That's exactly like signing your own death sentence.\e

{BLOCK:8}
"Tanakaaa!@ Don't die on me, Tanakaaa!@ And don't marry when you're still a high schooler, for fuck's sakeee!"@>
Tanaka died.@>
Unfortunately, he has been vaporized without a trace of his flesh remaning.#

{BLOCK:9}
"Waha-waha-waha-waha..."@>
The dimensionaling roars with laughter.@>
It was animated, so I feel that the scroll effect came a bit late.@>
"Goddammit!@ Tanakaaa!@ How dare you...!"#

{BLOCK:10}
{PCMLOAD:12}
In tears, I take out the Dimensional Vibration Cannon, my anti-dimensionaling portable weapon.@>
It indeed looks like a gun capable of exterminating dimensionalings.@>
"This is for Tanaka!"@>
I pull the trigger!@>
"Eat... THIS!"#

{BLOCK:11}
{PCMPLAY:0100}
{FLASH}
{PCMWAIT}
{PCMSTOP}
{PCMFOUT}
*Shoom*@ *Shoom*@ *Shoom*@ *Shoom*@>
Echoing retro sound effects that don't add up any tension, retro rounded beams fly away.@>
The Dimensional Vibration Cannon impacts on the dimensionaling dead-on.#

{BLOCK:12}
"Uoooooooooh..."@>
The dimensionaling screams as if it were talking through a cheap echo mic and then extinguishes.@>
"We did it...@ We fucking did it, Tanaka!"#

{BLOCK:13}
However, that was only the prologue of the battle.@>
Now, a lot of dimensionalings break the dimensional wall and appear here.@>
They gather in a single place screaming "EEEEEEE!" (a bit like Shoc*er from Kamen Rider) and start combining.@>
"Uoooh!@ I was expecting you fuckers to come!"#

{BLOCK:14}
They're not done combining yet, but I won't start attacking them.@>
It's a sort of give-and-take: if I hold fire now, they won't attack me while I combine in order to power up.@>
Otherwise the show would run out of recycled scenes.@>
That's a rule God himself imposed.#

{BLOCK:15}
{FLASH}
"Shaaaaaaaaaaam!"@>
They finished combining.@>
This is a Giant Ya*ool, a fusioned superbeast.@>
I designed it from memory alone so it looks kind of vague.\c
{BGMFOUT}
{BGMWAIT}
\e

{BLOCK:16}
"Alright, I'll combine and power up too!@ Aruwaiyaaa!"@>
{FLASH}
{BGMPLAY:20}
I yell and then Aruwaiya, the second power-up weapon that appeared in the latter half of the second season of the show, descends from the skies.@>
Its name comes from the way people say "aru janaika" (there IS [something]!) in Hokuriku, the author's homeland.@>
I thought it'd be cool, so I used it.#

{BLOCK:17}
{FLASH}
I combine with Aruwaiya and thus I'm reborn into Derengaiya, a fusioned spacetime superwarrior.@>
Its name means "I can't get out" in Hokuriku dialect.@>
However, this combination scene is long.@ If there weren't cuts this would be a recycled scene lasting 3 minutes.@>
Even worse, the animation director for this one scene was O*bari.#

{BLOCK:18}
A BGM starts playing.@>
Of course, I'm the one singing.@>
It'll be featured in the second volume of the OST.#

{BLOCK:19}
However, at that moment...!@>
{QUAKE}
*Pow!*\c
{BGMSTOP}
\e

{BLOCK:20}
"What?!"@>
I click my tongue in Gund*m style.@>
As this combination scene riddled with cliches of all kinds unfold, the Giant Ya*ool attacks me!@>
The BGM stops.@>
The kids in front of TV are paling.\c
{BGMPLAY:09}
\e

{BLOCK:21}
"T-That's dirty!"@>
"Waha-waha-waha-waha-waha..."@>
The Giant Ya*ool laughs.@>
"As a special event, we enemies can cancel a power-up only once in the entire show!"@>
Since it didn't feature any wavy scroll effect, the animation for its laugh looked strangely quick.#

{BLOCK:22}
I can't believe they're using their triumph card now!@>
Well, this is an auto-conclusive story, so it'd be a waste for them not to use it...@>
{QUAKE}
*Quake!*@>
Unable to combine, I'm crash against the ground.@>
"Goddammit!"#

{BLOCK:23}
Now, what will happen next?!#

{BLOCK:24}
Will a new character show the villians who's boss?!@>
Will the professor complete some of his witty inventions?!@>
Or will the main character shine gold with his secret true power?!#

{BLOCK:25}
"What's in store next episode?!@ What destiny awaits our hero, the combined spacetime super warrior Derengaiya?!"#

{BLOCK:26}
{BGMSTOP}
{QUAKE}
"Shut up!"\c
{CHARA:l34}
\e

{BLOCK:27}
{BGMPLAY:04}
Then, a girl sitting diagonally to me hits her desk and stands up.@>
I was getting so excited I started thinking out loud.@>
"Nagase!@ Stop interrupting the class!"@>
It's Ohta, the student council vice president.#

{BLOCK:28}
"H-Huh?!@ You're supposed to go looney at this point of the story!@ Why are you acting normally?!"@>
"Mind your own business!@ I'm not always going haywire through life, y'know?!"@>
"But, if you don't snap now, Shizuku's story can't begin..."\c
{CHARA:l33}
\e

{BLOCK:29}
"Don't worry about that."@>
"What?!"@>
Ohta giggles.@>
"This is a side-story unrelated to the main plot, so the story WILL advance, I guarantee you."@>
"Oh, I see."@>
Her explanation convinces me.@>
"Then it's like that one game where, once you complete a portion of the story, another story begins; its name is Kamaita--"\c
{BGMSTOP}

{BGMPLAY:04}
\e

{BLOCK:35}
"Sounds totally like a multipart story."@>
"It is."@>
"Hahahahahahahahahaha..."@>
We laugh in unison.@>
The students also laugh along.\c
{BGMFOUT}
{BGMWAIT}
\e

{BLOCK:36}
The screen fades out and the story meets a peaceful end.\c
{BG:000011}

{BLOCK:38}
............\c
{CHABG:l33011100}
{BGMPLAY:04}
\e

{BLOCK:39}
"Huh?!"@>
The screen rewound.@>
"They changed the line I was just about to say!"@>
"Don't sweat it, don't sweat it!"@, Ohta says grabbing my hand.@>
Her smile is stiff.#

{BLOCK:40}
"Huh?@ Wait, what was I about to say?@ I think it was a famous game title or something..."@>
{CHARA:l34}
"AAAAH, WHAT A FINE DAY WE HAVE TODAY, RIGHT?!"@>
Ohta yells flailing her arms.@>
"I wonder what it was..."#

{BLOCK:41}
*Slide!*@>
Then, the door of the classroom opens vigorously and my uncle makes an appearance.@>
{CHARA:r51}
"Oof...@ Oof.."@>
He's out of breath.@>
It seems he came running up here in a hurry.@>
"Yuusuke, this is an emergency!@ Come to the rooftop now!"#

{BLOCK:42}
"Huh?@ Weren't you supposed to call me three days later during break?!"@>
"Yeah, but we have a more urgent problem now!@ Anyway, come with me!"@>
"Wait just a minute.@ I'm about to remember something very important..."#

{BLOCK:43}
My uncle startles.@>
"Forget about that and come!"@>
{CHARA:l33}
"C'mon, Nagase, you can't make your uncle wait.@ Go, go..."@>
Ohta pushes me out of the classroom.#

{BLOCK:44}
"Heh, so this is your real persona, huh?@ You're always about to flip out, so I was wondering how you really were..."@>
"Why, thank you!"@>
An anger marks pops up on her forehead as she cracks a stiff smile.\c
{BG:000411}
\e

{BLOCK:45}
As I space out distractedly, my uncle takes me to the rooftop.@>
This is a non-skippable, mandatory event.\c
{CHABG:r51341104}
\e

{BLOCK:46}
"What the hell is this all about?@ What do you want from me now that Ohta hasn't snapped?"@, I say, and my uncle coughs only once.@>
"You see, an incident has occurred."#

{BLOCK:47}
I quickly connect the dots.@>
"In that case, the culprit is Tsukishima, the former student council president!@ He's manipulating the girls at school with his toxic electromagnetic waves!"@>
I'm a strong player who has cleared this game a lot of times.@ I know everything that will happen from now on.@>
"Let's go catch him!@ If we don't, terrible things will--"\c
{CHABG:r40311010}
\e

{BLOCK:48}
"That I what?"@>
"Ugh!"@>
When I turn around, Tsukishima's there.@>
"T-This sucker, uncle!@ He's behind this mess!"@, I say pointing to Tsukishima.#

{BLOCK:49}
"Stop it, will you?"@, Tsukishima says calmly.@>
"In this story I'm a minor character.@ I can't use toxic electromagnetic waves."@>
"Oooh, I see."@>
That convinced me.@>
"So, I don't have to worry about anything else, right?"@>
"HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA..."\c

{BLOCK:52}
"What?!"@>
The screen faded out only to turn on again.@>
"Isn't this over?"@>
"The real challenge is just about to begin."@, Tsukishima says.@>
"Huh?@ Real challenge...?"@>
"Of course, I'm talking about the war against the dimensionalings."@>
Tsukishima looks at me as if he had to state the obvious.#

{BLOCK:53}
"WHAAAAT?!@ We're really fighting against dimensionalings?!"@>
{CHARA:l51}
"Yeah.@ That's what this is story is about."@, my uncle says.@>
"We learned about this threat thanks to a NASA investigation..."@>
"Oof, that's SOOO retro!@ Uncle, if you think mentioning NASA nowadays gives you ANY extra credibility you're incurring into a BIG mistake."@>
"Well, it's the truth!@ I can't help it!"@>
My uncle makes a mountain out of a molehill.#

{BLOCK:54}
"According to their investigation, there's a super spacetime domain (A.K.A "Dimensional Sphere") that connects this world with the world of dimensionalings here in this school!"@>
"Wow, that's such a dick move.@ I mean, you're using complicated words to making it sound more like the real thing, but actually--"@>
"Hey, stop bitching me out!"@>
My uncle gets angry for real.#

{BLOCK:55}
"About that..."@>
Tsukishima joins the conversation.@>
"We've found out the exact location of the Dimensional Sphere."@>
"What?!"@>
As soon as he hears him, my uncle face stiffens out of nervousness.@>
"Where is it, Tsukishima?!"@>
"Chief, it is located in..."#

{BLOCK:56}
"--Chief?"@, I ask.@>
"Yes, he's the director of the special division of the dimensionaling criminal investigation department of the national anti-dimensional task force."@>
"Oh, you mean the "kokkaijigentaisakuhonbuijigenjinsousakatokubetsusousashitsu"..."
"DON'T TRANSLATE IT BACK!"@, Tsukishima orders bluntly.#

{BLOCK:57}
"The sphere is located beyond the never-opening door of the east wing of the first floor."@>
"I see, the never-opening door!"@>
My uncle's eyes spark.@>
"If there was a blatantly suspicious place like a never-opening door you should have investigated there first--"@>
"Commence operations now!"@>
"Yes, chief!"@>
Their conversation overlaps what I was about to say.#

{BLOCK:58}
"Good, now head to the scene at once!@ I'm counting on you, Yuusuke!"@>
My uncle and Tsukishima look at me at the same time.@>
"Wut?"@>
I'm speechless.@>
"I'M going... THERE?"@>
"Yeah.@", my uncle states in a casual manner.#

{BLOCK:59}
"......"@>
"Also, just so you know..."@>
My uncle pats my shoulder.@>
{CHARA:l50}
"There are no H-scenes in this story."@>
"WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?!"@, I scream out loud.#

{BLOCK:60}
"In addition, it's extremely likely you'll die and get a game over at some point, so remember to always save your game."@>
"H-Hold up!"@>
I quickly hold his horses.@>
"I refuse!@ For starters, why do *I* have to do it...?"#

{BLOCK:61}
"Because you're the main character, why else?"@, my uncle and Tsukishima say with natural expressions.#

{BLOCK:62}
"We can't let a support character end the story, right?"@>
"Oh, so you're aware you're support characters, huh?@ I see...@ Glad you guys are quick on the uptake."@, I whisper in a monotonous, almost vanished voice.@>
"Well, I'm leaving the rest on your hands."#

{BLOCK:63}
"......"@>
At this point I have no choice but to click "go back one choice" and cancel this story altogether.#

{BLOCK:64}
"However, in this story you can enjoy an exclusive, sweet special privilege."@>
"Special privilege?"@>
I unintentionally take the bait.#

{BLOCK:65}
"Of course, I'm not gonna send you to battle the dimensionalings alone."@>
"And that means...?"@>
"Ladies, enter!"@>
{REFCHAR:l99}
My uncle says that, and three girls come walking this way.\c
{ALLCHAR:l22c12r00}
\e

{BLOCK:66}
I remember their faces.@>
Of course, they're Mizuho, Saori and Ruriko.@>
They line up before me and bow firmly.@>
"Meh, it's the same three girls as always."@>
{REFCHAR:l51}
""Meh"?@ What do you mean "meh"?@ They're the Astral Busters, an elite unit of the anti-dimensionaling forces!"@, my uncle says clenching his fist.#

{BLOCK:67}
"What's that?"@, I ask with an apathetic voice.@>
"They're original anti-dimensional combat cyborgs built by our nation!"@>
"C-Cyborgs?!@ Y-You mean like androids and such?"@>
"Right."@>
{REFCHAR:r00}
"Now they play that role...?"@>
I turn to Ruriko, and she nods.\c
{REFCHAR:l51}
\e

{BLOCK:68}
"They're weaponized androids developed especially for close-combat against dimensionalings.@ You can leave the fight to them.@ Yuusuke, your job is to lead them.@ That's what this is story is about."@>
"Oh, is it?"@>
"Indeed."@>
"That's quite a frank way to put it."#

{BLOCK:69}
"Also, and don't fall off your chair when you hear this, you can take the three of them with you!@ Now, THAT'S what I call a special privilege!@ What do you say?!"@>
"Bleh, sounds boring."
"......"@>
"......"#

{BLOCK:70}
"Will you take this mission, Yuusuke?"@>
My uncle suddenly speaks like a king from Dragon Q*est.#
