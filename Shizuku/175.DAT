"Fine, you got it.@ I just have to do it, right?!"@>, I answer half-angry.@>
"Hahahaha, you were going to accept from the get go anyway, am I right?"@>
My uncle laughs.#

{BLOCK:1}
"Girls, first introduce yourselves to Mr. commanding officer here."@, Tsukishima says to the three girls.@>
"Oh, but that's not necessary.@ Everybody knows them already."@>
"No, that's not acceptable.@ According to the script, this is the first time you've met the girls."@>
"Huh?@ Oh, I see..."@>
Forced to accept such strange reasoning, I let the three girls introduce themselves.#

{BLOCK:2}
First off, Mizu--...@ I mean, the girl with glasses.@>
{BGMFOUT}
{BGMWAIT}
{BGMPLAY:06}
{REFCHAR:c22}
"Hello, my name is Mizuho Aihara."@>
She bows.@>
"My specialty is searching for enemies and analyzing information.@ I can discover enemies' weaknesses and space distortions.@ My codename is Mizzy."@>
"M-Mizzy?!@ What the hell?!"@>
"Please address me like that from now on."\c

Next is Sao--@ I mean, the girl with long hair.@>
"Yay!@ I'm Saori Shinjo, A.K.A Saorin!"@>
"S-Saorin?!"@>
"My specialty is direct attacks!@ Punches, chops and kicks!@ My final move is "Fireball Spike"!@ I boast the strongest combat power of all three!"@>
"T-That's helpful..."\c

{BGMPLAY:08}
{CHARA:c00}
\e

{BLOCK:4}
And last but not least is...@ (I know her well, though) a slightly absent-minded girl.@>
"Good afternoon."@, she says.@>
"H-Hello."@>
"......"@>
"Um, what is your name?"@>
"Ruriko."#

{BLOCK:5}
"W-What are your moves?"@>
"Eye lasers, chest vulcan, knees rocket launcher, etc.@ I specialize in long range combat.@ Oh, I'm also equipped with a chest..."@>
"Ack!@ Y-You're not gonna say breasts missiles, right...?"@>
"--A chest nuclear fusion generator".@>
"O-Oh, I was sure you'd--@ Wait, WHAT?!@ A n-n-nuclear reactor!!!???"#

{BLOCK:6}
"No need to worry.@ Design-wise, nuclear fusion is comparatively cleaner than nuclear fission.@ However, in case it receives an impact and explodes, small nuclear explosions will arise in a 500m radius..."@>
"Hoooly SHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIT..."@>
My face distorts as I scream just like that Munch painting.@>
"My codename is Ruriruri."\c

{BLOCK:7}
"Anyway, from now on you're their commanding officer.@ Use their cutting edge anti-dimensional weapons and seal the super spacetime domain behind the never-opening door in the east wing!@ I'm counting on you!"@>
{allchar:L22c13r00}
"Roger!"@>
The three girls bow firmly.#

{BLOCK:8}
"Hey, are Mizuho and Ruriko taking too much influence from Saori?"@>
{REFCHAR:c1D}
"Hey, what's that supposed to mean?!"@>
Saori glares at me.@>
"N-Nothing..."\c

{PCMLOAD:11}
And then...\c
{BG:341010}
\e

{BLOCK:10}
{PCMPLAY:0100}
"Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeek!"@>
{PCMWAIT}
{PCMSTOP}
{PCMFOUT}
I hear a the scream of a girl piercing through the school, and next...#

{BLOCK:11}
"Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!"@>
"Heeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!"@>
Following it, the screams of countless students echo one after another.\c
{BGMPLAY:19}
\e

{BLOCK:12}
"W-What in the world is going on?"@>
{CHABG:r40311010}
"The dimensionalings have initiated their attack."@>, Tsukishima whispers as his face turns palid.@>
"T-That can't be!@ What a sudden turn of events!"@>
{CHARA:l51}
"We can't afford to waste a second!@ Go, Yuusuke.@ Seal the super spacetime domain!"@, my uncle orders me as if he was a commander from Whatchamacallit Rangers.#

{BLOCK:13}
"Astral Busters, move!"@>
{allchar:L22c13r00}
"Roger!"@>
The trio bows firmly.@>
"R-Roger..."@>
I missed the timing.#

{BLOCK:14}
Thus, we commence our attack.\c

\e

{BLOCK:15}
When we return to the main building, all the students are gone.@>
"This is odd...@ Where did everybody go?@ Any ideas, Mizuho?"@>
She said her duty was to search for enemies.@>
{CHARA:r20}
"Um..."@>
Mizuho gives a step forward.@>
It looks like she wants to say something.#

{BLOCK:16}
"Do you know something?"@>
"Um, Yuusuke, I'd like you to address me by my codename when giving me orders."@>
"Huh?@ Oh, sorry.@ Then, Mizzy...!"@>
{CHARA:r22}
"Yes!"@>
"Survey this terrain and give me a report!"@>
"Roger!"@>
I'm already experiencing headaches.\c
{CHARA:r2C}
\e

{BLOCK:17}
*Beep*@ *Beep*@>
Some electronic device sounds.@>
Whoa!@>
Mizuho's eyes are sparking green!@>
Numbers like "01010111" run horizontally across her eyes.@>
Oh my god, she's the real deal!#

{BLOCK:18}
"That said, it must be a pretty slow CPU if we can see the binary numbers in action..."@>
{CHARA:r2B}
"I-It is an excellent piece of software!"@>
Mizzy says a bit embarrassedly.\c
{CHARA:r2C}
\e

{BLOCK:19}
"Analysis complete!"@>
"Results?"@>
{CHARA:r2B}
"We've already stepped into a different dimension!"@>
"W-What did you just say?!"@>
I overreact so that the kids watching the show understand how shocking this is.@>
{CHARA:r22}
"It's a simple outer-dimensional space of a limited area.@ Simply put, it's like the "Pod*eal Space" that appears in the manga "Win*man"."#

{BLOCK:20}
"Mizzy!"@>
"Yes!"@>
"How old are you?!"@>
"I'm 17."@>
"How do you know about that manga then?@ You had to read it while you were about to enter elementary..."\c

"Yuusuke!@ A strong space distortion emerged at 12 o'clock!@ They're approaching!"@>
"W-What?!@ I'm not done talking about that manga yet..."@>
{CHARA:l1D}
"This is no time for that!"@>
Saorin contributes with the pun.\c
{REFCHAR:l99}
\e

{BLOCK:22}
As soon as she says that,@>
the space before our eyes warps and an eerie silhouette appears.#

{BLOCK:23}
{CHARA:L61}
"That's it!"@, Mizzy shouts.@>
"That's our enemy, the dimensionaling!@>
"T-That is..."!
{FLASH}
*Flash*!@>
I stop moving in a dramatic pose.@>
Too bad it won't show up on-screen.\c

{REFCHAR:L61}

{BLOCK:27}
The dimensionalings are approaching at alarming speed.@>
They're faster than we expected!@>
And then, the enemy speaks in a strange voice.#

{BLOCK:28}
"I'll sign your T-shirt."#

{BLOCK:29}
He's speaking in dimensionalese, so I don't know what he's saying.\c
{REFCHAR:r00}
\e

{BLOCK:30}
{FLASH}
*Beem!*@>
Ruriruri shoots lasers from her eyes.@>
They impact on the dimensionaling's body scattering shiny light.@>
{CHARA:l1D}
"Yaaah!"@>
Saorin jumps to attack.@>
{QUAKE}
{QUAKE}

She pounds the enemy with a flurry of strikes.\c

"Analysis complete."@, Mizzy shouts.@>
"Alright, report it!"\c
{REFCHAR:L61}
\e

{BLOCK:32}
"Codename: Jiro.@>
Influenced by a baseball manga he read long time ago, he believes he's a professional batter, but nobody else acknowledges it.@ He often fights with the security guards before the stadium.@ He also steals colored papers of the fans crowding in front of the stadium waiting for signs and signs them himself.@
--That's it."#

{BLOCK:33}
What a twisted guy.@>
We encountered a freaky fellow right off the bat.\c
{allchar:L61r15c99}
\e

{BLOCK:34}
Jiro takes up a bunt stance.@>
"?"@>
Saorin takes the chance and attacks by surprise.@>
*Swing*@>
Not letting a fly in, Jiro swings his bat (which looks a bit too obviously like a broom).#

{BLOCK:35}
{QUAKE}
*Bam!*@>
"Augh!"@>
{REFCHAR:L61}
"Saorin!"@>
Saorin goes away flying, rolls on the ground and bumps against my feet.#

{BLOCK:36}
"O-Ouch...@ Goddammit."@>
Saorin shakes her head and stands up.@>
{REFCHAR:c1D}
"You're dead meat!@ Yuusuke, let me beat the crap outta him!"@>
"Okay, go ahead, but I'll decide how you attack.@ Strike him as I tell you to do."@>
"R-Roger..."#

{BLOCK:37}
Now, how will we attack him?@>
His specialty is batting...@>
Alright.@>
We have to fight fire with fire.@>
Beating him in his own game will be a true victory.#
