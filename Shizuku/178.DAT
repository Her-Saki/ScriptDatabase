"Ruriruri, you carry anti-dimensional weapons all over your body.@ Attack it in the most effective way based on the data we previously collected!"@>
{REFCHAR:c00}
"Understood."@>
Ruriruri nods and gives a step forward.@>
{CHARA:c99}
*Shing!*@ The hatch on her arm opens up and a strange device appears on it.#

{BLOCK:1}
"Give it your best, Ruriko!"@>
I encourage her waving a hand.@>
{CHARA:r10}
"By the way, I've wondering this for a while now, but why are you polite ONLY with Ruriko?"@, Saorin asks.@>
"......"@>
"......"#

{BLOCK:2}
{FLASH}
*Beeem*@ *Beeem*@ *Beeem*@ *Beeem*#

{BLOCK:3}
Along with that noise, energy starts focusing on her arm.@>
"Hey, why is that?"@>
While her strange device releases purple electricity, Ruriruri narrows her eyes and sets her aim.@>
This is really her most lethal anti-dimensional secret weapon--@>
{CHARA:r12}
"C'mon, tell me why!"@>
"Shut up!@ Who cares about that?!"\c
{REFCHAR:L62}

At that instant, our surroundings are covered with pure white light.#

*BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEM!*@>
A bright energy beam impacts on <-->\c

{BLOCK:6}
"Ah, that is...!"@, Mizzy screams.@>
"Do you know what it is, Raiden?!@ I mean, Mizzy!"@>
{CHARA:r22}
"Yes!@ If my memory serves me right, that's the legendary Inspire Beam!"@>
"What the hell is that?!"@>
"To put it simply, it's a beam that speeds up the time around the target!"\c
{REFCHAR:L62}

{BLOCK:7}
{FLASH}
*Zoop-Zoop-Zoop-Zoop-Zoop-Zoop-Zoop-Zoop...!*#

{BLOCK:8}
It's working exactly as she said.@>
The time around <--> is flying at a crazy fast speed.@>
Five minutes pass in an instant and its batteries die out.@>
The morning of the mastering process has only arrived around him!#

{BLOCK:9}
"Mizzy!"@>
{REFCHAR:r22}
"Yes!"@>
"What is this "mastering" exactly?!@ Answer me!"@>
"It's the last stage of game development!@ At this point the game must be 100% complete!"@>
"Exactly!@ You're pretty savvy, Mizzy."@>
I stroke her hair.@>
{CHARA:r28}
"Yuusuke...@ *Blushes*"\c

After suffering for a while, <--> is eliminated.#

{BLOCK:11}
"Mission complete!"\c
{REFCHAR:L99}
\e

{BLOCK:12}
That was the last "sound" it released.@>
It has been now completely vanquished.\c

\e

{BLOCK:13}
"You did it!@ Amazing work, Ruriruri!"@>
After releasing that high energy beam, Ruriruri lies exhausted.@>
I run over to her and embrace her by her slim shoulders.\c
{BGMPLAY:12}
{CHARA:c03}
\e

{BLOCK:14}
"Was I useful, Naga...?"@>
"Of course, Ruriruri!@ We won thanks to you!"@>
"I'm... glad..."@, Ruriruri says before fainting.\c
{CHARA:c99}
\e

{BLOCK:15}
"Ruriruri, get yourself together!@ Ruriruriii!"@>
{CHARA:r20}
"She entered deep sleep in order to replenish energy."@, Mizzy says.@>
"--I see.@ Good job, Ruriruri."@>
I stroke her cheek.#

{BLOCK:16}
"Alright.@ Saorin, carry Ruriruri on your back."@>
{CHARA:l12}
"Aye aye sir."@>
Saorin bestrides the toilworn Ruriruri on her rear.@>
(Those are some difficult words)\c

{BLOCK:17}
We barely managed to win the battle.#

{BLOCK:18}
"Let's hurry ahead."@>
We proceed across the hallway.@>
{BG:220404}
\e

{BLOCK:19}
The stairs are on sight.@>
We can take a shortcut climbing down the stairs and then leaving for the courtyard.\c
{BGMPLAY:05}
\e

{BLOCK:20}
*WOOOOOOM!*@>
"!"@>
The space warps.@>
At that moment, the third dimensionaling appears.#

{BLOCK:21}
{CHARA:L63}
- Chapter 3 -@>
- <Dark ambition> -@>
- Enter ORIBASS, the super-lazy music programmer -#

{BLOCK:22}
The title card is up.#

{BLOCK:23}
"Fuck!@ They predicted we'd take this shortcut?!"@>
{REFCHAR:r22}
"Data analysis... complete!"@>
*Slide*@>
I trip.@>
"That was WAY too quick..."@>
"I'm used to it.@ Also, its data is short."@>
"I see.@ Alright, let that report come!"@>
{CHARA:r2C}
"Yes!"\c
{REFCHAR:L63}
\e

{BLOCK:24}
"Codename: ORIBASS."@>
Hypotensive night owl.@>
My bass is just a bluff.@>
--That's it."#

{BLOCK:25}
"True, it was very short...@ Well, whatever, hurry up and discover its weakness!"@>
{REFCHAR:r2C}
"Yes!"\c
{REFCHAR:L63}
\e

{BLOCK:26}
At that moment, ORIBASS attacks us swinging its bass guitar.#

{BLOCK:27}
"Heeeeeeeeey!"#

{BLOCK:28}
ORIBASS screams in a monstruous, spine-chilling dimensionalese.\c
{BGMFOUT}
{BGMWAIT}
{BGMPLAY:19}
\e

{BLOCK:29}
Its first target is Mizzy.@>
{REFCHAR:r27}
"Oh!"\c
{REFCHAR:L63}
\e

{BLOCK:30}
"Today's sooo coooold..."#

{BLOCK:31}
ORIBASS attacks Mizzy with its bass.@>
"Mizzyyyyyyyy!!!!"@>
"Eeeeeeek!"#

{BLOCK:32}
*Gsssh!*@>
{allchar:L63r1Dc99}
By a hair's breadth, Saorin comes to the rescue and stops the bass with her hands.#
"Well done, Saorin!!"#

{BLOCK:33}
However, she's being steadily pressured down.@>
Saorin is the most powerful of them three, but ORIBASS is even more powerful.@>
"H-Hurry up and find its weak point..."@, Saorin says out of breath.#

{BLOCK:34}
"Today's sooo coooold..."#

{BLOCK:35}
ORIBASS power increases even more.@>
"I-I can't take it anymore...@ I've hit my limit..."@>
And then, Mizzy screams:@>
{REFCHAR:c29}
"Weak point detected!"@>
"What is it?!"@>
{CHARA:c2C}
"According to this... he's short on cash!"@>
"Perfect!"\c
{REFCHAR:L63}
\e

{BLOCK:36}
I take out the last 10k yen bill from my wallet and approach ORIBASS.@>
Then I...\n
