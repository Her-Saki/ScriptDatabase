Saorin pushes Mizzy and me away.@>
Then, the space gets crushed under a massive pressure.@>
The air around us compresses and a crater forms on the concrete floor.@>

Tsukishima opens his attache case and takes out two mysterious glass bottles from it.@>
"We have to throw one of these to the enemy."@>
"Only one of them?"#

{BLOCK:42}
"One of them is a drink that combines Super Solmac and Hyper Cabbage Juice, very effective with hangovers.@ The other one combines beer, brandy, bourbon, japanese sake, vodka, shochu, wine, unrefined sake and other drinks into one alcoholic beverage.@ One of them must be its weakness.@ You decide which one will be more efficient!"@>
"But both are completely different"#

"One of them will have a positive result, and the other one a negative result.@ It's a 50/50 gamble."@>

"Well, if you're worried, you can save the game.@ If you fail you can go back one choice, so don't sweat it.@ Wahahaha..."@>
