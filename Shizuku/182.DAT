"Alright!@ Let's try that Infinity Combination!"@>
{allchar:r22l03c12}
"Roger!"@, the three of them say in unison.@>
"Leeeeet's cooooombine!"\c

\e

{BLOCK:1}
The BGM changed.@>
After that, despite it's not shown on-screen, the level of the art has improved too.@>
This is like a recycled scene used in every episode.@>
And because of that, enemies are not allowed to butt in.#

{BLOCK:2}
First the girls release yellow electromagnetic beams, and then they form in V shape with Saori in the center.@>
{CHARA:c1D}
"Infinity Combination...@ Engage!"@, Saorin shouts.@>
{allchar:c99r2Al00}
"Roger!"@>, Mizzy and Ruriruri answer at the same time.\c
{REFCHAR:c00}
\e

{BLOCK:3}
{FLASH}
*Bzzzzzzt!*@>
A sphere of light scattering electricity sparks appears in Ruriruri's hand.@>
She formed it by compressing ultra-energy.@>
"Mizzy, let's go."@>
{QUAKE}
*Blam!*@>
Ruriruri does a professional volleyball serve and passes the ball to Mizzy.@>
It looks like a technique you would find in P*wer Rangers.\c
{REFCHAR:c22}
\e

{BLOCK:4}
"Nice serve!"@>
{CHARA:c2C}
Several electronic numbers shine brightly on Mizzy's glasses as she looks upwards.@>
*Beep-Beep-Beep-Beep-Beep-Beep*@>
"Traveling speed: 40, rotation speed: 3.5, temperature: 52, air temperature: 14, distance to the enemy: 12, relative velocity: 18, tomorrow's sporadical cloudiness on a bright day..."#

{BLOCK:5}
*Beeem!*@>
I'm not sure what's the need to calculate things that far, but Mizzy's ultra-high performance (?) bio-computer gives out an answer.@>
{CHARA:c26}
"Victory depends on the tides of fortune!"@>
{CHARA:c22}
"Saorin, throw me a pass!"@>
{QUAKE}
*Plam!*@>
Mizzy passes the ball.\c
{CHARA:c1D}
\e

{BLOCK:6}
{PCMLOAD:12}
"Alright!@ Let's goooo!"@>
Raising a cloud of sand dust (from where?!), Saorin soars high in the sky (what about the ceiling?!) and makes an arch jump.@>
{FLASH}
*Flash!*@>
Something flashes radiantly behind Saorin.\c

{BLOCK:8}
*Wham!*@>
As the recycled CG so familiar to us appears on screen, Saorin gathers all the power of her body and smashes the ball with all her might.@>
{FLASH}
{QUAKE}
*Thomp!!*#

{BLOCK:9}
*FOOOOOOOOOM!!*\c
{CHABG:L66121010}
\e

{BLOCK:10}
Creating up a vigorous tornado with a lightning tail, the ball flies in a straight line towards the dimensionaling.#

{BLOCK:11}
{FLASH}
*Flash!!*#

{BLOCK:12}
The energy ball impacts directly on Rodimas' chest and winds up a big explosion.#

*Booooooooooooooom!*\c

{BLOCK:14}
Its destructive power was overwhelming.@>
All the area around--@ No, the entire school was shaken up with its terrific mayhem.@>
"Amazing.@ So this is the power of Infinity Combination, huh?@ It was beyond anything I had imagined..."@>
*Smoke...*@ *Smoke...*@>
The smoke still hasn't cleared up.@>
"With such a mighty attack he shouldn't last a second..."\c
{BGMFOUT}

\e

{BLOCK:15}
*Hazy*@ *Hazy*@>
{REFCHAR:L66}
However, when the smoke dissipates, surprise!@ Rodimas' shadow appears.@>
It's still alive!@>
While it's all beaten up, it's standing firmly on its legs.#

{BLOCK:16}
"W-What a tough customer.@ Saorin, Mizzy, Ruriruri!@ Put him down!"@>
When I order them that, Rodimasu who's barely standing on its feet begins to talk.\c
{BGMPLAY:12}
\e

{BLOCK:17}
"You really grew up.@ As your father, I feel nothing but proud."#

{BLOCK:18}
W-What the hell is wrong with this guy?!@>
"Hey, you!@ What the hell is that "father" horseshit about?!@ First off...!"@>
{REFCHAR:r26}
"Daddy!"@>
However, someone suddenly shouts that behind my back.@>
Turns out to be Mizzy.#

{BLOCK:19}
"Huh?!@ H-Hold up..."@>
{CHARA:l1A}
"Daddy!@ Don't dieee!"@>
{allchar:r26l1Ac01}
"Don't die on us, dad."@>
Even Saori and Ruriruri are calling him like that now.@>
The three of them run over to the dimensional crying.@>
"H-Hey, girls..."\c
{REFCHAR:L66}
\e

{BLOCK:20}
"Please understand that I did all this in order to awaken your powers.@ I made you go through several harsh things in the actual game...@ Forgive your father..."\c

{REFCHAR:L99}
Rodimasu's body shines brightly before disappearing.@>
Why is this guy dying solemnly while the others dimensionalings kicked the bucket in such a gruesome way?!@>
That's the privilege of the script writer.@>
I feel like I'm hearing the resentful groans of the other dimensionalings.#

{BLOCK:23}
{ALLCHAR:r23l1Ac01}
The three of them slowly stand up and look up to the sky as they wipe their tears.@>
Despite they look upwards, the ceiling is above them.@>
The three of them whisper: "I'll give it my best, so please watch me from afar".@>
"Hey!@ Didn't Tsukishima build them in this script?!"@>
{allchar:r20l10c00}
The three of them don't answer anything.\c
{BGMFOUT}
{BGMWAIT}
\e

{BLOCK:24}
Well, it doesn't matter.@>
If we worry over such little details, this script will never be finished.@>
Let's go on to the next scene!\c
{BG:540303}
\e

{BLOCK:25}
And so we finally stand before the never-opening door.\c
{BGMPLAY:11}
\e

{BLOCK:26}
"When we open this door, it'll be finally time for the..."@>
{CHARA:r20}
"Super spacetime domain."@>
"Yeah, exactly!@ Probably the enemy attacks will be more powerful than ever before, so get your weapons ready!"@>
{allchar:r22l13c00}
"Roger!"@>
The three of them say in unison.#

{BLOCK:27}
"That's fine and all, but where did Tsuki--@ I mean, Dr. Tsukishima go?@ He appeared just a moment ago, but he went elsewhere again."@, I was saying, when...\c
{REFCHAR:c42}
\e

{BLOCK:28}
"Wahahahahahaha!@ I'm right here, gentlemen!"@>
Just when I thought I was hearing his voice, Tsukishima appears before my eyes.#

{BLOCK:29}
"Oh, Tsukishima.@ Were you always there?@ By the way, what's so funny?"@>
{CHARA:c41}
"What, you ask?@ Huhuhuhu...@ Your stupidity, of course."@>
"...?"@>
"It seems you still can't see where you're standing.@ Well, it doesn't matter.@ You'll perish here anyway!"@>
Tsukishima...@ I mean, this guy says a line extremely typical of a villian.\c

{BLOCK:30}
"W-What are you saying, Dr. Tsukishima?!"@>
"Tsukishima?@ Huhuhu.@ That's the name of the human I ate beforeeeeeee!"@>
{CHARA:c43}
"Who the hell are you?!"@>
For the time being, I'll counter with a run-of-the-mill reply.@>
"Thank you for asking.@ I am..."@>
His body transforms more and more.@>
He looks just like...!\c

{BLOCK:32}
"I am the heaven-sent child of destruction, Deathzard!"#

{BLOCK:33}
Uah, it's finally here!@>
A combined dimensionaling!@>
The Yap*ols from Ult*aman A also combined in the end to launch a last offensive.@>
It's textbook scripwriting at its finest.@>
Well, if they're all combined in a single enemy to attack, that saves us time.@ Good for us.#

{BLOCK:34}
But anyway, this enemy looks lame as hell...@>
{allchar:L67r22C99}
"Analysis complete!"@>
Naturally, the development of the second part is fast.\c
