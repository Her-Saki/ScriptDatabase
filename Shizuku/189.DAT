The BGM changed.@>
That means that, despite it's not shown on-screen, the art level skyrocketed.@>
This is like a recycled scene used in every episode.@>
And because of that, we can recycle the text below as well.#

First the girls release yellow electromagnetic beams, and then they form in V shape with Saori in the center.@>

A sphere of light scattering electricity sparks appears in Ruriruri's hand.@>
She formed it by compressing ultra-energy.@>

Ruriruri does a professional volleyball serve and passes the ball to Mizzy.@>

Several electronic numbers shine brightly on Mizzy's glasses as she looks upwards.@>

Its destructive power was, of course, overwhelming.@>
Its terrific power shook the entire school!@>

Its moves are, indeed, awe-inspiring.@>
All of Deathzard's attacks stop exactly one milimeter away from impact.@>
It's a real martial arts master.@>
Its combat ability surpasses every dimensionaling we've fought so far.\c
