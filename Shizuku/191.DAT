"Of course, we can only rely on the power of love!"@>
{allchar:l00r20c14}
"T-The power of love?!"@, Saorin says blushing.@>
"Yeah, love!@ Love always triumph!"@>
"That sounds kinda hypocritical!"#

{BLOCK:1}
"It's not!@ You shouldn't think of love as mere kindness to others!@ Love means monopolozation and sexual desire, and it's an unsightly emotion brought about by the human instinct of not being able to live alone!"@>
{allchar:l00c14r20}
"An unsightly instinct...?"@>
"Exactly!@ Love is nothing but just another instinct.@ If you measure it with a rational gauge, love is only an euphemism for obscene desires.@ Love is nothing but a form of ambition!"\c
{allchar:l00c14r2B}
\e

{BLOCK:2}
"But, can we defeat the dimensional emperor just by unifying that ugly emotion?!"@>
"Yes, we can!@ Ambition is the most powerful weapon we humans have!"@>
{allchar:l00r20c10}
"But, aren't there other desires like apettite and sleep?"@>
"Do you think great power can come from synchronizing apettite and sleep?"@>
{allchar:l00r20c1B}
"Well, no, but..."@>
Saorin blushes.#

{BLOCK:3}
"Besides, that desire we call "love" possess a special side not present in other desires!"@>
{allchar:l00r20c10}
"And that is...?"@>
"Hunger and sleepiness are purely individualistic desires, but loves holds the power to influence other people!"@>
"Other people...?"#

{BLOCK:4}
"Exactly!@ And also, humans can carry that love to a positive direction!@ More concretely speaking..."@>
"Yes...?"\c

Emperoleaf, the leader of dimensionalings, is evidently scared.@>
Our love power combined is being magnified towards a positive direction!\c

But it's a comfortable heat!@>
My body starts to radiate faint light.@>
Eventually, that light shines so brightly that I can't even open my eyelids!#

*Fsshhh*@ *Fsshhh*@ *Fsshhh*@ *Fsshhh*@>
The Dimensionaling Emperor gets defragmented at the cellular level.@>
The moment it crumbles down, Emperoleaf divides back into each one of the dimensionalings.@>
Strangely, all of them look extremely happy.\c
{BGMFOUT}
{BGMWAIT}
\e

{BLOCK:21}
"Thank you."#

{BLOCK:22}
I hear their voices for the last time.@>
"Huh?!"@>
Perhaps it was an auditory hallucination.@>
However, I'm pretty sure I heard their voice.#

{BLOCK:23}
Perhaps they weren't bad guys, after all.@>
Maybe they just went wild just before the mastering.@>
Were they wishing for this from the very start?@>
I can't help but think about that possibility.\c

"It's over.@ It's really over..."@>
The long (REALLY long) battle with the dimensionalings ends at last.@>
Now that we've closed the contact point with them, peace reigns once aganin in the school campus.\c

"Now peace has returned to school."@, says Mizzy.@>

Ruriruri just stands there smiling.\c

Now that the battle with the dimensionalings is over, it's time for us to separate.@>
As I think about that, I feel that it'd be nice to fight against one more dimensionaling.\c

{allchar:l10c00r20}

{BLOCK:29}
"By the way, Yuusuke."@>
Then, Mizzy calls my name.@>
When I turn around, I see the three of them staring intently at me.@>
"What is it?"\c

\e

{BLOCK:30}
"Um, I'm happy that you love us three, but..."@, Saorin says blushing.@>

"Um..."@>
"Um...?" (Mizzy, Saorin, Ruriruri)\c
{REFCHAR:l99}
\e

{BLOCK:33}
I dash out and escape,@>
but at that instant, the camera stops.@>
I come to a standstill with an awkward face.@>
And then, my voice sounds.#

{BLOCK:34}
"Gimme a fuckin' breaaaaaaaaaaaak!"\c
{BG:000111}

{BLOCK:35}
The black frame doesn't close up.@>
After a pause, only the space around my face spins around.\c

"What kind of textbook end is this?@ How can you end such a long story THIS way...?!"\c
