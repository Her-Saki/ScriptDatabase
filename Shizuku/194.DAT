Just as I imagined, this is the ending.@>
We lost the fight against the dimensionalings.#

{BLOCK:1}
You must not take them lightly.@>
In all likelihood, the next attack of the dimensionalings will obliterate us from the world.@>
This is your chance to select "Return to last choice" and redo everything.@>
However, if you have never seen this ending before, you might as well turn the page.@>
A genuinely boring ending awaits you there.#

{BLOCK:2}
Come on, the next one is the final page.@>
This is your LAST chance to turn back.#

{BLOCK:3}
{QUAKE}
{FLASH}
*BAM!*@>
At that instant, I'm attacked by the dimensionaling and my consciousness fades away.@>
{BGMFOUT}
{BGMWAIT}
{BG:000611}
Before me, freezing darkness spreads everywhere.@>
Yeah, I'm...@ dead.@>
And as they warned, this ending was ridiculously boring...#
