` *Click! Click!*@ I stretch the lead of my mechanical pencil again and again as I let it run meaninglessly through my notebook, until eventually, the lead breaks apart and some specks hit my cheek.\

` The sluggish wind swaying the beige curtains makes this class feel even more like a silent, colorless film shot in a faraway world.\

` Inside the classroom lighted by the western sun, the dead-eyed students write down rows upon rows of characters in their notebooks as they gulp in great lungfuls of chalk dust.\

` As weird as it may sound, these recent days I feel like time is advancing in a MUDDY way.@
` As if every day the same film is projected at exactly the same time...@ It's a strange feeling indeed.\

` A repetitive, invariable, futile routine.\

` At some point in time which I'm unable to specify, all the color and sound of this dull world vanished.\

` However, I'm not really affected by it.@ Instead, I embrace this indescribable heat inside me and, as usual, forget myself writing scribbles in my notebook.\

` I let my pencil run silently across the notebook, and draw a circle in a page of my brand-new college notebook, filled with blue ruled lines.@ It's the same circle I'm used to draw every day.@
` This way, I immerse myself in my own wet, sticky dreamworld...\

` The circle represents the Earth.@
` Since I created it, it is only mine.\

` Unfortunately, this Earth of mine I drew will have to be destroyed.@ It's a 1:1 miniature of the Earth where we're all living now.@
` The polluted sky and oceans, the garbage dump-like cities, and the social structure designed for enslaved, lifeless people are exactly like our world.\

` The apocalypse always comes when you least expect it.@

` I draw small circles around the main circle.@ These are explosions from a new type of nuke that burn and destroy everything.@
` All of a sudden, an explosion occurs without warning.@
` The earth splits and cracks, the sky rampages, and flames erupt creating a burning hell.@
` Their fingers and earlobes blown away, people run from the flames aimlessly.@ They escape without knowing what the hell happened to Earth so out of the blue.\

` My apocalyptic fantasy doesn't stop there.\

` However, there's nowhere to escape.@ It's impossible, because the Earth itself is falling apart and is about to disappear.@
` Despite they run so desperately their legs are torn off, and so fast their lungs burn out, there's just no way they can escape from the end of the world.\

` In an automatic motion, I keep drawing more and more circles.@ The places where the nukes explode meet a gruesome, ultimate destruction.@
` As people gradually lose their own world, they kick each other to make way and crawl around the surface looking to shelter themselves.\

` I leave a single safe place on purpose while the rest of the world is being engulfed by flames.@
` After trampling down on others in order to survive, those ugly, pathetic creatures called humans group there to save their lives.@
` As they breathe out poisonous gas from their almost rotten mouths, every single one of them start pleading for mercy.@
` "Please save us!"
` "Why are we being punished?!"\

` I slowly lift my right arm as if teasing them, and as I hear their desperate appeals and screams, I mercilessly draw the last nuke.\

` At that very moment, I feel like I'm actually hearing the screams of millions of people at once.@
` I feel an intense rush of blood through my whole body.\

` This unspeakable excitement makes me feel agitated.@
` Once I wake up from my fantasy, I slowly let go of my pencil and I'm astonished to notice my palm is sweating A LOT.\

` Every time I'm struck with these vivid delusions during the day, I feel shivers fierce enough to make my hair stand on end.@
` However, I can't deny I feel a bit of guilty pleasure when the blood pumps through my veins.\

` During class, there's a part of me that enjoys intoxicating itself with drug-like fantasies, and a part of me that fears the other one.@
` Those wild dreams become more lifelike and realistic every day, and at the same time, the real world becomes more dull and soundless.
` Blazing, blood-pounding insanity on one side, and dry, withered rationality on the other.\

` Perhaps I'm getting far away from this boring reality as I tread little by little into the world of madness...\

` Thinking about that, I let my gaze wander through space, and then...\

` "Huhuhuhu..."@
` I hear a dry laugh echoing through the classroom.@
` Strangely, despite that laugh should be soundless to me, I can hear it loud and clear.@
` "Huhuhuhu..."@
` The students stop writing in their notebooks and turn their heads to that creepy laugh.\

` The student laughing is a girl that sits diagonally to me.@
` Obviously, I know her face.@ However, I can't recall her name.\

` She gazes absent-mindedly outside the window, and despite the teacher didn't even call out to her, she slowly stands up, all while chuckling.@
` As she's illuminated by the western sun, her silhouette is projected in the wall before her, just like a faint shadow picture.\

` "What's wrong, Ohta?"@
` The teacher that was writing rows of characters akin to worms crawling across the blackboard stops his hand holding the chalk.@
` Ohta...@ Yeah, she's Ohta.@ She's the student council president, and she's always surrounded by a group of girls.@
` "Huhu, huhuhu...@ Haha, hahahahahahaha..."@
` Her giggles turn into a loud laughter, and still facing to the window, she keeps laughing joyfully.\

` The class looks at her a bit spooked.@
` "Hey, what's wrong with Kanako?"@
` "She creeps me out..."@
` The students' whispers mix with Ohta's chuckles.\

` Then, Ohta strikes her desk full-force with both hands.@
` All of a sudden, the classroom becomes dead silent.@
` Before the perplexed stare of the students, she mutters a single word in a low voice:@
` "Sex."\

` After a brief moment, the entire classroom burst into laughter.@
` "Hahahahahahaha!@ That was nasty, Kanako, but really funny!"@
` "Huahahahaha!@ What the fuck, Ohta?!@ You horny or somethin'?!"@
` Without paying attention to the desperate efforts of the teacher to calm things down, the students' hysterical laughter pierces the air and resounds through the classroom.\

` "Huhu, huhuhu.@ Gimme some, c'mon.@ Gimme some dick.@ I can't take it anymore.@ C'mon, be cool.@ I want a dick.@ You hear me?@ A DICK!@ I wanna a dick!@ Put it inside me!@ Thrust it into my hot, wet, drenched pussy!@ I wanna have sex, right here, right now!@ I wanna do iiit...!@ I WANNA FUUUUUCK!!@ Sex, sex, sex, sex, sex SEX SEX SEX SEX SEX SEX SEX SEX SEX SEX SEX SEX...!!"\

` The students' laughs gradually fade out.@
` Just like a broken CD player, she repeats the word "Sex" endlessly.@
` Now, not a single student is laughing anymore.@
` It's clear to everyone that Ohta's not in her right mind.\

` "KYAAAAAAAAAAAH!!"@
` At that moment, a girl's scream breaks apart the desolate atmosphere of the classroom.@
` The students watch the scene with their breath taken away.@
` Ohta tears out her own face scratching it with her nails, and as a result, both of her hands become red with blood.\

` The teacher that was watching dumbfounded comes to his senses and rushes over to Ohta.@
` He holds down her hands, but it's too late.@ Both her face and her uniform are already dyed bright red with blood, a vivid hue that reminds me of tomato juice.@
` Amidst an eerie silence, an abnormal nervousness overwhelms the students.\

` Immediately, two boys along with the teacher holding her down take Ohta, who is competely covered by blood, to the infirmary.\

` After Ohta and the others leave the classroom, the noise resumes and the students begin to make a fuss again, as if they cut a tense thread hanging over them.@
` Every single of the students was creeped out by her sudden self-harming attack.@
` However, as for me...@ I know it's strange, but I felt an indescribable affinity towards her.@
` That's right...@ She entered the realm of madness a bit earlier than me.@ Perhaps that's the reason.@

` After seeing that puddle of bright red blood inside the classroom illuminated by the western sun, bit by bit, reality started to gain color again.\

` Before long, I hear the distant sound of an ambulance coming closer.\

` It's been three days since Ohta's incident.@
` Out of the blue, she lost her mind and began to scratch her own face until turning it into a bloody pulp.\

` According to her family and friends' testimonies, she behaved completely normal before that day.@
` However, she went crazy specifically in the day of the accident.\

` "Y'know?@ The other day I tried to talk with her like usual, and Kanako turned her face slowly with a creeeeepy smile.@
` I kid you not, that was DISGUSTING!@ It was exactly like the face of a ghost I saw in a TV show the other day.@ Maybe by then she had already gone bonkers, who knows?"\

` Naturally, Ohta became the trending topic of every classroom for the next two days after the incident.@
` They say she was hospitalized in a general hospital in order to operate her, and that she'll be transferred to a psychiatric ward next week.@
` People's also spreading careless rumors about the source of her insanity.@
` That she was always neurotic, that she did drugs...@
` There's even a theory according to which her boyfriend cheated on her and she was left so traumatized that wanted someone to rape her.\

` However, as anybody would expect, three days later people got tired of that topic and established a sort of weird "pact of silence", so Ohta's incident became a taboo issue.\

` Until yesterday's afternoon everyone was talking excitedly about Ohta, but as soon as someone suggested making a pact of silence, they immediately turned tails.@
` I think every single of them are coward sheeps.@ They act according to other people's reactions, and instead of holding their own opinion, they follow blindly whatever trash the mass believes.@ They're really stupid.\
