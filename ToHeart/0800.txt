` I'm strolling around the commercial district.@
` I stop by a bookstore to do some stand-reading, but I notice a little kid crying at a side of the shop.@
` This 5, 6 years old child is wailing at the top of his lungs.@
` The passersby just keep walking on without giving a damn.@
` "Geez…"@
` I approach the kid.@
` "You okay, bud?"@
` I ask.\

*01
` "Mom… Mom… *Snif*"@
` The kid just repeats "mom" again and again without answering.@
` "Did you lose your mom?"@
` The kid nods among tears.@
` "I'm gonna look for her.@ What's her name?"@
` "*Snif*… Yukiko."@
` "And yours?"@
` "Hiroaki"@
` "Hiroaki, huh?@ How old are you?"@
` "*Snif*… 5."@
` "5?@ You're going to elementary next year!@ You can't be crying just because you separated from your mom."@
` "*Snif*"

` I thought she'd be nearby since they separated while shopping, but I can't find her at all.@
` "I'm tired…"@
` Hiroaki sits down on the floor.@
` Can't blame him.@ We've been walking nonstop for nearly an hour now.@
` His frail kid legs have reached their limit.@
` I smile awkwardly,@
` "Alright…@ Time for a piggy-back ride, Hiroaki."@
` and turn my back to him, still squatting on the ground.

` With Hiroaki on my back, we cast around for his mother, and after three hours of roaming about the wide district, we finally run across her.@ By then, the sun is deeply sunken over the horizon.@
` Turns out his mother was searching for him outside the district.@
` I could've spared myself the trouble and leave him at a police box, but I chose to accompany him till the end.@
` Maybe because I had the same experience as a kid.@
` Anyway, by the time I reach home I'm so tired my feet are outright killing me.
