` Turns out my classmate, Lemmy Miyauchi, was the one grabbing my arm.@ She has a bursting smile on her face.@
` Actually, her name is longer than that, but she says she shortened it when she moved to Japan.\

*02
` She was born in California, and moved here three years ago together with her family.@ In short, she's a half-japanese blonde chick.@
` Being a foreigner makes her well-known in the school, so I know about her a bit, but that's it.\

*03
` Anyway, I'm positive this cotton-like softness spreading through my arm is something I could have never experienced in my own country.@
` "Hiroyuki?"@

` The only girls that call me by my name are Lemmy and my mom.@
` … I'll correct myself:@ Lemmy is the only GIRL that does that.\

` Only a halfie like Lemmy could be so proficient in Japanese.@
` She often mixes bits of English here and there, but her pronunciation is almost perfect.@
` However, she goes one step further and adds obscure proverbs and aphorisms into her speech that not even a Japanese language teacher would know.@
` "Lemmy, what do you mean with that quot--"@
` I ask her the meaning behind her words…@
` "I'd be nice if we could go STEADY from now on♥"@
