` Alright, where will I go?@
` I'm tired of always eating at Yc's on my way home from school, and there aren't a lot of great places around here.@
` The most reasonable choice would be the katsudon outlet I dropped by the other day.@
` Yeah, that will do.@
` I head towards that restaurant…| but inmmediately step on the brake.@
` Now that I remember, there's a family restaurant in the neighborhood.@
` I almost don't visit it since it's expensive, but I think it'd be a nice change of pace.

` "Why, then?"@
` "DAD told me that I should learn social skills."@
` Social skills, huh?@ I see.@
` It's true that working part-time it's a good way to hone them.@

` It looks like it could burst open anytime.@
` It's designed for Japanese sizes, so of course it wouldn't fit a blonde chick like Lemmy.\

` "What will you order, Hiroyuki?"@
` "Huh?@ Order?"@
` "Yeah.@ Check out the menu."@
` "Oh, s-sure."@
` I was so captivated by Lemmy that I forgot why I came here.\

*08
` I take a quick look at the menu.@ 
` "What's the house special?"@
` Everything in the menu, like steak and hamburgers, looks so generic and dull that I don't see any of this as remotely appetizing.\

*09
` "We recommend the Italian lunchset."@
` Lemmy points to an Italian-ish dish with spaghetti and shellfish dressed with red tomato sauce.@
` There's way too much food in a single dish.@
` "I can't even tell what the ingredients are."\

` "See, this is tomato and eggplant fettucini.@ The base is tomato sauce with red pepper added for spice.@ The sweetness of the eggplant matches the…"
` "Stop.@ I want something with more "punch" if you know what I mean, but nothing too heavy."\

` "Then I recommend you the Japanese hamburger set!"@
` "Hmm, but I eat that every day.@ I'd like to try something different now that I'm here.@ Don't you guys have some "unusual" dish?"@
` "Then you'd love the churrasco set!"@
` If I recall correctly, a "churrasco" is a big piece of grilled meat that you eat little by little cutting it with a knife.\

*0c
` "Oh, sound nice.@ It's that beef that you cut with a knife, isn't it?"@
` "No, no!@ It's served already cut."@
` "Oh, so it's just plain yakiniku, then."@
` "But it's delicious."@
` "Uh, okay, but I'll pass.@ I'll just pick the Japanese hamburger."@
` I should have chosen that from the start.\

` "Excellent.@ What would you like for drink?"@
` Lemmy's speech is so polite it sounds unnatural.@
` This family restaurant's etiquette is scary…@
` "A beer, please!"@
