` "Hi, Hiroyuki!"@
` All of a sudden, someone calls me with a unique intonation.@
` It's Japanese, but mixed with English accent.@
ChangeCharacter 02 0a 02
` Yeah, no doubt it's her.@
` "Hello."@
` I answer waving a hand, but…\

*01
` "Huh?@ Those clothes…"@
` I notice Lemmy is wearing a costume I'm not used to see.@
` She notices I'm staring at her, and then…@
ChangeCharacter 02 0a 05
` "You see…@ I'm in the KYUDO club!"@
` she says with a broad smile.\

*02
` ""KYUDO"?@ Oh, do you mean the archery club?"@
` It's that sport where you hit a target with a bow, right?@
ChangeCharacter 02 0a 02
` "I joined in order to study Japanese culture".@
` Additionally, Lemmy tells me about her purpose.@
` That's indeed a pretty foreigner-like reason…\

*03
` "When did you join?"@
` "I'm in it since I entered highschool."@
` "Heh…@ So you've been there for a whole year, then."@
` "YES."\

*04
` "How good are you?"@
` I ask for the heck of it.@
` I think Lemmy and archery match as well as bread and butter.@
` If she were to wear western clothes, she'd totally look like a female Robin Hood.@
` Or so I thought…@
ChangeCharacter 02 0a 06
` "Terrible!@ I have no idea where the arrow will fly."@
` because she straight up kills the concept I imagined.\

*05
` On second thought, a Californian girl like her might not be the best fit for martial arts.@
` "I don't think it suits your style.@ Couldn't you try something more fitting?@ Like, cheerleading or something…"@
` Was I too harsh telling her it's not her thing?@
ChangeCharacter 02 0a 05
` ""When in rome, do as the romans do".@ I live in Japan now, so I ought to study your culture."\

*06
` "So you don't care if it's not your thing, huh?@ Well, it's fine as long as you're having fun."@
` "Yes, I love Japanese culture."@
` "Glad to hear that."@
` I nod.@
` Seeing how passionate she is about learning about Japan makes me feel compelled to focus on studying.

` However, Lemmy lets out a sigh.@
` "I don't like still targets."@
` "Still targets?@ It's not a shooting range, so there's no moving targets in archery."@
` "That's not what I mean, Hiroyuki.@ I'm talking about living targets."@
` "Huh?"@
` I startle a bit.

` "Don't you find exciting and thrilling to corner a living prey?"@
` She says spellbound.@
` "What happens to the prey after it's cornered?"@
` Since we're at it, let's ask the rest of the story.@
` "It gets CAUGHT by the hunter."\

*09
` "I don't know what kind of prey you're talking about, but don't you feel bad for it?"@
` "WHY?"@
` Lemmy asks with a blank face.@
` "Why?@ It's wrong to kill animals just because you find it "thrilling"."@
` "But they're prey.@ It's only natural they're hunted."@
` "Hey, wait a minute.@ Why are you talking about prey and hunting in the first place?@ That's dangerous."@
` "Really?"\

*0a
` "Yeah.@ Do you know about Yagamo, the duck?"@
` ""Yagamo"? Wuzzat?"@
` Looks like she doesn't.@
` Does that mean she didn't live in Japan at that time?@
` Anyway, I don't remember when it happened, so I decide to tell her directly.\

*0b
` "This is quite an old story.@ Some idiot shot a duck in a pond with an arrow."@
ChangeCharacter 02 0a 05
` "Did they catch it?"@
` Lemmy asks brimming with excitement.\

*0c
` "No, that's not the point!@ They hit the duck, but the arrow pierced it without striking its vitals.@ Since then, the duck kept living with the arrow thrusted in its body."@
` As I tell her, the rage I felt the day I saw it on the news wells up inside me.@
` I don't know who was behind it, but it takes a real son of a bitch to do something like that.@
ChangeCharacter 02 0a 02
` "‥…"@
` "Later, people captured the duck and cooperated to remove the arrow from it.@ The culprit didn't give a fuck, but it caused serious trouble for Yagamo and the people who had to help it."\

*0d
` "Why didn't they shoot again?"@
` Hey, are you for real...?@
` "'Cause they were heartless.@ Do you expect a person who enjoys making an animal suffer to kill it for mercy?"@
` "In the US, hunting is a well-established entertainment.@ You can't succeed if you hold pity for your prey."@
` "Entertainment?"@
` "On weekends, our family used to go camping to a lake in Oregon and shoot waterbirds."@
` Shooting waterbirds in Oregon, huh?\

*0e
` However, despite she names that American place as her own home, I can't quite picture it in my mind.@
` "I've heard about Oregon before, but where is it located?"@
` Lemmy smiles broadly.@
ChangeCharacter 02 0a 05
` "There are three states in the West Coast.@ Starting from the north you have Washington, Oregon, and California.@ Get the picture now?"@
` I see, so Oregon is a state.@
` I place those three states in my mind one below the other, in the west coast of a very vaguely shaped American map.\

*0f
` "Yeah, I think I got it now.@ Going to camp and hunt with your family sounds very American."@
` "I used to hide in the grassland with Dad and hold the rifle like this…"@
` As she explains, Lemmy imitates pointing a gun,@
` "Set the aim and… BANG!"@
` and shoots.@
` Aided by precise movements, her acting looks oddly realistic.@
` "HIT!@ Hahaha!"@
` She's even playing astutely the part where she hits the target.@

*10
` "Have you ever shot a real gun, Lemmy?"@
ChangeCharacter 02 0a 02
` "Air guns only."@
` Oh, air guns…@ But still, she's talking about real hunting rifles that can even kill people.@
` They're not to be confused with kid toys.@
` "I kinda envy you."@
` Her acting felt real because she has actually experienced it.@
` I'd like to shoot a gun too, even if only once.\

*11
` When you're used to handle guns from an early age you want to shoot them all day long.@ I understand that feeling.@
` Lemmy's obsession with hunting is a withdrawal symptom caused by her stay in Japan where hunting is banned, or at least that's my theory.\

*12
` Oops, we've lost the thread of the conversation.@
` "I get your point, but Yagamo wasn't a prey.@ It was shot as a prank."@
` "Really?"@
` "Yeah, I'm telling you."@
` "I see…@ Poor Yagamo."@
` "I'm glad we think alike.@ By the way, "Yagamo" is a nickname written with the characters for "arrow" and "duck", not an animal species."@
ChangeCharacter 02 0a 06
` "Japanese language goes VERY deep, doesn't it?"@
` "‥…"
