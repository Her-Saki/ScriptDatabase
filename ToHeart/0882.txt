` "What is so urgent that you bumped against me out of the blue?"@
` I ask, still sprawling on the hallway's floor.@
` I gotta keep this situation going for as long as possible.@
` "Are you okay, Hiroyuki?@ Can you stand up?"@
` Worried about me, she kindly reaches out a hand.@
` If possible, I'd like to stay in this stance for a little more, but I give up and take Lemmy's hand.@
` It feels so soft and warm...@
` Resigning myself, I stand up.

` "Thanks."@
` "Aren't you hurt?"@
` Lemmy asks terribly worried, as if I were seriously injured.@
` "Nah, I'm perfectly fine."@

` "What reason?"@
` In a bold motion, Lemmy tangles my arm with hers.@
` Her sudden closeness makes me feel a bit nervous...@
` I guess this level of intimacy is the norm in the US.@
` "Tell me why!"\

` "I was peeking into your skirt!"\

*05
` Ain't no way I could tell her that.@
` "Nothing."@
` "Then, can I ask you something?"@
` "What?"@
` "Do you like kids?"@
` "Huh...?"@
` I'm not sure how to react to that.@
` Why does she bring up that topic now?!\

` "If I like children?"@
` To be honest, I'm curious about how she'd react to my answer.@
` "YES!"@
` "Who's children?"@
` Maybe she refers to OUR potential kids?@
` That weird concern flashes through my mind.@
