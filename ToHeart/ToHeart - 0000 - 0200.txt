` "Seasons always flow casually."@
` Despite every day felt slow and sluggish, seasons began to change frenetically after I composed that poem.\

*02
` Before I realized, it was spring.@
` The opening season where anxiety and hope fill our hearts.@
` The blue sky spreading everywhere… Radiant sunlight… Peach-colored petals dancing in the fresh wind.\

*03
` Before I realized, it was summer.@
` A bright, dazzling season.@
` The sun shining down upon us… Shadows projected sharply… Cicadas crying loudly… Cumulonimbus clouds spreading out far away.\

*04
` Before I realized, it was fall.@
` The season of crimson twilights.@
` The vivid hue typical of this season… The crunchy sound fallen leaves make when you step on them… Refreshing wind… Early dusks… The deep red sun scorching the sky.\

*05
` Before I realized, it was winter.@
` The white season where snow stacks up.@
` Wind cold enough to make your body shrink… Footprints left on the snow… White breath… and our hands we warm up with it.\

*06
` And thus, once more, spring comes back.

` The cherries' flourishing has arrived a bit earlier than previous years, and all the trees are already in full bloom.@
` We walk side by side through a faintly illuminated, pink-colored tunnel.@
` As the wind blows, the petals fall like snowflakes in a snowstorm.\

` "Oh, you have some there too.@ Let me wipe them."@
` Using my shoulder as support, Akari stands on tiptoes.@
` As if she were stroking my head with affection, Akari removes the petals from it.@
` Her face is just before mine.@
` "…‥"@
` I don't know where else to look, so I drop my gaze to the floor.\

` "What is it?"@

` I drink the hot tea I poured in a bottle cap,@
