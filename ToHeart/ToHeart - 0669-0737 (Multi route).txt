` When I leave the classroom to buy myself a drink, I spot Shiho and Masashi conversing in the hallway.@

ChangeCharacter 01 09 01
` "Oh, &~.@ Shiho was telling me about that famous robot."@
` "Robot?"@
ChangeCharacter 00 04 02
` "Yep.@ A maid robot."@
` "A maid robot...?"\

*01
` Maid robots are generic androids that grew massively popular in recent years.@
` They're handy, human-skinned cyber-servants used in diverse environments such as family homes and offices.\

*02
` Up until just recently they were high-profile machines impossible to acquire for personal use, but the current competition between manufacturers and the success of each company's mass production lowered the price as cheap as two cars, so now even your average salaryman can afford one if they push themselves a little.@
` Currently, they're commercialized by big electronic companies as well as foreign firms, thus creating a large market that moves the economy on.\

*03
` No less than five years ago owning a maid robot at home was nothing but a wet dream, but the marvelous advances in tech and computing turned that fairy tale into reality in the wink of an eye.@
` In the city you can spot as many maid robots as foreign cars, and if you drop by a manufacturer's showroom, you'll get to know the latest models on display in the showcases.@ Sometimes even the robots themselves serve you personally.\

*04
` Now that I remember, the other day I visited a local showroom in my neighborhood and a maid robot poured me some coffee.@
` The newest models are so well done it's impossible to tell them apart from a human at first glance.@
` In fact, back then I thanked that robot because I mistook it for a normal girl.@
` Tech progress never ceases to amaze me...\

*05
` Originally, the pet name "maid robot" referred exclusively to home-oriented female models, but these became so popular that now everyone calls generic androids as a whole like that.@
` However, even though nowadays maid-robots are commercialized in all sorts of models, their history has just started.@ After all, it's been only a few years since the first machine was developed.\

*06
` At the beginning, these robots were developed by Japanese medical equipment manufacturing companies with extensive government support, and their purpose was nursing bedridden elders.@ They were called "home helpers".@
` That ancient prototype machine featured a cubic, functional design that looked nothing like today's maid robots.@ They turned more human-like following patients' needs, and as more functions like cooking, laundry, or cleaning were installed into them, they gradually transformed into the maid robots we currently know.\

*07
` "So?@ What's up with that robot?"@, I ask Shiho, who in turn looks at me with a surprised face.@

` "You REALLY don't know?"@

` "Part of it is resentment over losing my job, but more than that is the fact that they're machines.@ I feel like the world will become boring with those soulless automatons.@ The sight of never-complaining androids working silently doesn't strike me as particularly agreeable."@
` Too many pigeons have gathered in a single place, so I throw the feed far from there.\
