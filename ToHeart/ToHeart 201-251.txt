` I hold her knees on my hands, trying to force her legs open.@
` "Ah…"@
` Akari lets out a little gasp as she attempts to resist.@
` However, that doesn't last long, because she loses strenght and leaves her legs at my mercy.\

*1d
` "So this is yours, huh…?"@
` "…‥"@
` This is the first time I see her intimate zone.@
` Between her smooth, white hills is her slightly pink vulva.@
` Her petal is still small, like a bud.@
` With my fingertip, I trace a line along her entrance.@
` "Ah…"@
` Making a wet sound, my fingertip enters a little inside her gap.@
` I move my finger up and down…@
` "Ow…@ Oww…"@
` and Akari's hips shake.\

*1e
` At the bottom of the crack, a somewhat viscous and transparent nectar drips from her vulva, which is still closed.@
` I smear my fingertip with it, and draw a little circle around her crack.@
` "Ahh…"@
` And with a finger of my other hand, I open her entrance drawing a V.@
` At that moment, her soaked, shiny petal becomes exposed along with a wet sound.\

*1f
` "Ah…!"@
` Her vulva soaked in nectar is exposed before my eyes.@ Unable to withstand her embarrassment, she covers her face with both hands.@
` "T-This is so embarrassing…"@
` For an instant, I get a peek inside her vagina, but it immediately shuts again.@
` "I feel so embarrassed, Yuki…"\

*20
` "Akari…"@
` I slowly bring my lips close to her vulva, and lick around the bud.@
` "Ah…!"@
` I move my tongue up and down, inserting the tip every now and then.@
` In the upper part of her crack, her small, isolated bud receives the caresses of my tongue as well.@
` "Aaah…"\

*21
` Her flower bud is still enveloped in foreskin.@
` I tear off the foreskin with two fingers, and start licking the sensitive head that comes forth shyly.@
` "Uwaah, uwaaaah…"@
` As I caress her stiffening protuberance with my tongue, I slide a fingertip in the center of her vulva.\

*22
` I take my time to caress her.@
` "Ah…@ Ah…@ Yuki…@ Yuki…"@
` Letting out painful gasps, her body shakes uncontrollably.@
` Once my fingertip enters her vulva relatively smoothly…@
` "Y-Yuki…"@
` Akari calls my name with flushed cheeks.\

*23
` She lets me know that she's ready to receive my shaft.@
` Even her vulva that was closed tight moments ago is now overflowing with transparent nectar, and it's gently spreading out.@
` I get on my knees and lean over her.\

*24
` "Akari…"@
` "Yuki…"@
` We'll finally become one.@
` But as soon as I think about that, a lot of worthless thoughts cross my mind.\

*25
` Akari has been by my side since we were children.@
` In kinder, elementary, middle school… and high school too, always with me.@
` I always thought of her as my real little sister.@
` I did…| up until just recently.\

*26
` This girl exposed salaciously before my eyes is, without a doubt, Akari.@
` The same Akari who I used to hang out with as siblings.@
` "…|…|…"@
` But is that really true?@
` Is it true that she's the same?@
` Why is she… naked like this before me?\

*27
` "Yuki…?"@
` She calls out to me with clouded eyes, and I come to my senses again.@
` "Y-Yeah…?"@
` "What's wrong?"@
` "N-Nothing…"@
` I answer with an awkward smile.@
` Her expression is undecipherable.\

*28
` What's gotten in my mind?@
` Isn't it obvious that she's Akari?@
` The same Akari I know and love.@
` The same Akari that was always my little sister…\

` Since Akari became so close to me, I couldn't see her as an object of desire anymore.@

` The lower part of my body brought to light my true feelings.\

*0c
` I don't understand my own feelings.@
` I know that I love her.@
` She's so dear to me that I don't want to give her to anyone else.@

` Maybe I just can't see her as more than my little sister.@

` "A-Ahh…@ Nn…"@
` After a while, my finger gets slightlty soaked with her juices.@
` I cover the entirety of her genital zone with my palm, and rub it up and down while applying a soft pressure.@
` Focusing on her flower bud enveloped in foreskin, I gently fondle the surroundings of her petal and entrance.@

` Taking care not to scratch her with the nail, I tickle her abdominal wall with my finger.@
