I let my pencil run silently through the blue lining of my brand-new notebook in order to form a circle.@ It's the same circle I'm used to drawing every day.@>
This way, I immerse myself in my own wet, sticky dreamworld...#

{BLOCK:1}
This circle represents the Earth.@>
Since I created it, it is only mine.#

{BLOCK:2}
Unfortunately, this Earth of mine I drew will have to be destroyed.@ It's a 1:1 miniature of the Earth where we're all living now.@>
Its polluted sky and oceans, garbage dump-like cities and social structure designed by enslaved, lifeless people are exactly like our own world.#

{BLOCK:3}
The apocalypse always comes when you least expect it.#

{BLOCK:4}
I draw small circles around the main circle.@ These are explosions from a new type of nuke that burns and destroys everything.@>
All of a sudden, an explosion occurs without warning.@>
The earth splits and cracks, the sky rampages, and flames erupt creating a burning hell.@>
Their fingers and earlobes blown away, people run from the flames aimlessly.@ They escape without knowing what the hell happened to Earth so out of the blue.#

{BLOCK:5}
My apocalyptic fantasy doesn't stop there.#

{BLOCK:6}
However, there's nowhere to escape.@ It's impossible, because the Earth itself is falling apart and is about to disappear.@>
Despite they run so desperately their legs are torn off, and so fast their lungs burn out, there's just no way they can escape from the end of the world.#

{BLOCK:7}
In an automatic motion, I keep drawing more and more circles.@ The places where the nukes explode meet a gruesome, ultimate destruction.@>
As people gradually lose their own world, they kick each other to make way and crawl around the surface looking to shelter themselves.#

{BLOCK:8}
I leave a single safe place on purpose while the rest of the world is being engulfed by flames.@>
After trampling down on others in order to survive, those ugly, pathetic creatures called humans group there to save their lives.@>
As they breathe out poisonous gas from their almost rotten mouths, every single one of them start pleading for mercy.@>
"Please save us!"@>
"Why are we being punished?!"#

{BLOCK:9}
I slowly lift my right arm as if teasing them, and as I hear their desperate appeals and screams, I mercilessly draw the last nuke.#

{BLOCK:10}
At that very moment, I feel like I'm actually hearing the screams of millions of people at once.@>
I feel an intense rush of blood through my whole body.\c

{BLOCK:11}
This unspeakable excitement makes me feel agitated.@>
Once I wake up from my fantasy, I slowly let go of my pencil and I'm astonished to notice my palm is sweating A LOT.#
