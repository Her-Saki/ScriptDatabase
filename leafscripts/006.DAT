Uncommonly, today's break my uncle asked me to come to the teachers' office.#

{BLOCK:1}
My uncle is my father's second little brother, and a contemporary Japanese language teacher that works in this school.@>
Despite we're family, we're not very close.@>
When I was a kid he used to visit my father and me regularly, but in the last ten years he never showed up if not for big family reunions, and as far as personal meetings go, we had none.@
We often pass by each other in the hallway, but we only exchange a polite smile or greeting, and that's where our bond ends.#

{BLOCK:2}
Moreover, having a relative teaching in one's school can get pretty... annoying.@>
Not only he doesn't let me know the exams' content beforehand and whatnot, but he leaks secrets about my school life to my parents and vice versa.@>
To make matters worse, despite we treat each other as family, we have to act as a teacher and student in the face of society, which results in awkward situations.@ I find that really irritating.#

{BLOCK:3}
I try to avoid him as much as I can.@
He knows I find it difficult to deal with our relationship, so he doesn't contact me regularly either.#

{BLOCK:4}
That's why is so rare of him to call me to the staff room.#

Once I reach the office, I give a small, polite nod, and enter through the door.@
I look around for my uncle.@

"Oh, Yuusuke.@ I'm here."@
When I turn my gaze to the voice, I find my uncle behind a pile of textbooks.@
As I approach him, he leaves the teacup in his desk and gets up from his chair.@
"Come to the rooftop."@
He says patting my shoulder.\c

{BLOCK:6}
He takes me up to the rooftop.@
The mild sunlight and somewhat chilly wind feel refreshing.@ I look out over to observe in a sweep the urban landscape that surrounds the school.#
