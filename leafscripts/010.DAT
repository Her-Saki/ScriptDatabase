"Did you call me to help you theorize about this?"@>
"No, there's actually another reason but, c'mon, keep me company a little more.@ Now, tell me, any other rumors you have heard of?"#

{BLOCK:1}
"That she was dumped by her boyfriend, and..."@>
"That she was raped?"@>
It was hard for me to say that, but my uncle spat it out without hesitation.#

{BLOCK:2}
"Yes, there's a theory about a possible sexual assault."@>
"Actually, I think that's where her insanity stems from.@ You share classroom with her, so I'm pretty sure you heard what Ohta screamed as she tore apart her own face."@>
As my uncle tells me that, I picture vividly what happened that day in my mind.#

{BLOCK:3}
That day, Ohta was chuckling while looking outside the window, and then she started to shout dirty words as if she was possessed by a demon.@>
She straight up asked for sex.@ Since Ohta stands out so much among our class, boys reacted inevitably in an oversensitive manner.@>
Judging by her speech, it's possible that the root of her madness is somehow related to sex.@>
I think that's what my uncle is talking about.#

{BLOCK:4}
"Well, I'm only telling you this because it's you, but she already had sexual experience with men.@ It seems she had sex the day previous to the incident."@>
"How do you know that?"@>
"The results of her medical check-up."@>
"Did they go that far...?"@>
I picture Ohta inside a white-walled hospital room as a bunch of unknown doctors examine her intimate zone.@ It feels somewhat revolting.#

{BLOCK:5}
"So you're narrowing down the source of her mental issues to problems with men?"@>
"Yeah."@>
{CHARA:r50}
My uncle takes out another cigarette from his breast pocket, puts it into his mouth, and lights it.@ After inhaling the smoke with a deep breath, he points his gaze at the urban landscape beyond the fence.#

{BLOCK:6}
"Ohta's parents said she recently (though we're only talking about two weeks prior to the incident) started to skip town frequently by night."@>
Cigarette smoke rises from my uncle's mouth.@>
"Perhaps she went to her boyfriend's house."@>
"No, it seems that's not the case."@>
He directs his gaze to me and curls slightly his lips.#

{BLOCK:7}
"It looks like she came here, to the school, by night.@ Perhaps this part will be nasty to hear, but that's what she wrote in her diary."@>
"So the school investigated even her diary just like the police would do?"@>
"Don't be like that.@ That was also a request from Ohta's parents, and..."@>
"And what?"@>
"If we're not careful, this incident could escalate into a criminal case."#
