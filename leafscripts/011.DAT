"In her diary they found..."@>
My uncle cuts himself short.@>
"It's bizarre.@ She started writing in it three weeks ago and, from that date onwards, she became compelled to come to school by night for whatever reason.@ Most of the pages of the notebook are blank, though."#

{BLOCK:1}
"What are the contents of the diary?"@>
He shakes his head slightly, exhales a puff of smoke, and simply says "nothing".#

{BLOCK:2}
"It only says "I went to school".@ That's it."#

{BLOCK:3}
21/2 - Tonight I'm going to school.#

{BLOCK:4}
22/2 - Tonight I'm going to school.#

{BLOCK:5}
"And so on and so forth.@ Rather than a diary, it looks more like she was keeping track of the days she went to school."@>
"She jotted down those notes before leaving home, right?"@>
"Yeah.@ I don't know why, but I assume she wanted to leave a record that she actually came."#

{BLOCK:6}
"Did she write down her reasons for coming?"@>
"Unfortunately no, she didn't.@ But I don't think she'd came without a good reason."@>
My uncle smiles awkwardly as if he said "well, duh", and gulps in a good lungful of smoke.#

{BLOCK:7}
The wind blows away the puff of smoke he breathes out, which tickles my nose.@>
"However..."@>
Taking me by surprise, my uncle resumes his explanation out of the blue.@ He has a serious look on his face.@>
"This was written on Sunday, the day prior to the incident."#

{BLOCK:8}
My uncle takes out a piece of paper from his pocket and hands it over to me.@>
"I copied it from her diary."#

{BLOCK:9}
2/3 - Today I'm not going to school.@ Despite it's Sunday, third year teachers showed themselves at work.@ They'll stay at office until late night, so today I won't go.@>
I can't stand it.@>
I can't stand it.@>
How can the other girls endure this?!@>
I'm going straight to his home.#

{BLOCK:10}
"What do you think about this, Yuusuke?"@>
""What"?@ I'm not a detective, you know?"@>
"A layman's opinion can be helpful, too."#

{BLOCK:11}
Without even realizing it, I feel like my uncle is tangling me up more and more in this case.@>
He said this incident could escalate to a criminal case, right?@>
If that's true, should I be giving freely my opinion like this?#

{BLOCK:12}
My uncle is not just questioning me; he also wants me to do something afterwards.@ That much is clear.@>
What does he want me to do?@ Heaven knows.@>
Shouldn't I stop here before I get further involved in this incident?@>
However, strangely, I DO have a strong desire to know everything about this case.#

{BLOCK:13}
Poor Ohta got trapped in the world of insanity...@ That "other" world I saw before.@>
What did she see back there, and what is she seeing now?@>
Perhaps I can move closer to that world by walking the same path as her.@\e
