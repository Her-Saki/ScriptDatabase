{BLOCK:0}
I sigh as I watch my uncle leave, and then point my gaze towards the landscape beyond the fence.#

{BLOCK:1}
I took on a troublesome business.@>
I already have a hunch that this matter will become more messy than I expect.@>
If this really turns out to be the dangerous incident that my uncle thinks it is, perhaps I shouldn't meddle in it at all.@>
If I'm not careful, I could be putting myself in danger.@>
I give a slight sigh.#

{BLOCK:2}
You could say it was just meant to happen, but now that I accepted to cooperate, there's no turning back.@>
I'll start investigating as soon as today.@>
First of all, I'll go and meet Shinjo.@>
I should probably interview her next break.@>
Classes are about to start, so I'll do it after they're over.@>
Anything I'm gonna do I should do it after I'm done with classes.#

{BLOCK:3}
I turn back to the entrance that leads to the stairs in order to return to my classroom, but then...@>
"!"@>
{BGMNEXT:08}
{BGMFOUT}
{CHABG:r00311010}
I see a girl standing up just before me.@>
I didn't notice her at all.@ Despite she didn't say a word, I startled so much I felt my heart was about to escape from my throat.\c
{CHARA:r03}
\e

{BLOCK:4}
Before my surprise, she narrows her eyes and chuckles.@>
"Sorry for scaring you."@>
She says despite she continues to giggle.@>
Automatically, her laughter reminds me of Ohta.@>
I know this girl.#

{BLOCK:5}
She's Ruriko Tsukishima.#

{BLOCK:6}
We shared class last year, but I never had a real conversation with her.@>
"How long have you been there, Tsukishima?"@>
{CHARA:r00}
"Since last year.@>
"Huh?"@>
Unintentionally, I furrow my eyebrows.@>
"I've been here since last year, Yuusuke Nagase."@>
I'm at a loss for words before her incomprehensible answer, but my consciousness focuses on the fact that she remembers my full name.#

{BLOCK:7}
Tsukishima is a gorgeous girl.@ A beauty that surpassed every girl in our class from last year...@ No, all girls from every year.@>
I think she's way prettier than those models that appear on TV commercials, or even finely crafted french dolls.#

{BLOCK:8}
She's a hard-to-approach Venus, and on top of that, she's always reading books.@>
A very quiet girl, indeed.@>
If she were a character from an old classical novel, she'd probably be described as a closeted maiden.@>
That's why I never talked to her.@>
Not only I, but all the boys of our class had a hard time communicating with her.@>
But that same Tsukishima remembers my name.@>
My FULL name, even.@>
That makes me a little happy.#

{BLOCK:9}
"Since last year?@ Do you mean you've been here literally for a whole year?"@>
"Yes.@ I think I was here a year ago today.@ I come as long as it doesn't rain, of course."@>
Tsukishima says chuckling again.@>
Influenced by her, I laugh too.@>
This is unexpected.@ I didn't know Tsukishima uses to joke like this.@>
"I have a good reception on sunny days."@>
Tsukishima says all of a sudden.@ She smiles innocently like a child and looks up to the sky.@>
{CHARA:r02}
She reaches both of her white arms towards the sun as a strong gush of wind blows past her.@>
"They're just like radio signals."#

{BLOCK:10}
"Huh?@ What do you mean?"@>
"I can hear them clearly on sunny days, but when it rains, they become static noise just like the sound of the rain."@>
"Do you mean radio signals?"@>
"Both sound like static, yes, but the static of the radio sounds different from the rain.@ The raindrops absorb the radio's electromagnetic waves and they're washed away to the drainage, thus not reaching home properly.@ That's why, on rainy days, you should open a subterranean manhole and get under there to listen to them clearly."@>
"What are you talking about, Tsukishima?"@>
{CHARA:r00}
"Denpa waves."#

{BLOCK:11}
"Denpa waves?"@>
"Yes.@ I collect denpa waves every day.@ Usually, though, I use a metallic antenna to catch normal waves."@>
I don't have the faintest idea what's she on about.@>
Radio?@ Denpa waves?@ Antennas?@>
"However, I can't catch my own denpa waves with an antenna, so I use my own body instead.@ I become an antenna myself."#

{BLOCK:12}
{XPOS:6}
{SPEED:0}
1. "So, basically, you're catching denpa waves here in the rooftop."\n\e

{BLOCK:13}
{XPOS:6}
{SPEED:0}
2. "I don't understand anything about antennas, denpa waves or that sort of things."\n\e

{BLOCK:14}
What exactly is Tsukishima talking about?\n\e
