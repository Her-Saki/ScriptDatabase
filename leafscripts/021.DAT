"I don't have that power within me..."@>
It's fine that I went along with her joke, but I feel I'm just ridiculing her.@>
So, instead, I'll tell her the truth.@>
"I'm sorry that I'm not like you."@>
"No, you DO have the power.@ You're way more powerful than I am."@>
As she talks, she grips my hand softly and moves it close to her chest.#

{BLOCK:1}
Her white, soft, and slightly cold hand grabs mine delicately.@>
"It's happening as we speak.@ The denpa particles I collected are flowing towards you one after the other.@ Can you feel it?"@>
Tsukishima tilts her head a bit and narrows her eyes.#

{BLOCK:2}
*Thump*@ *Thump*@ *Thump*...@>
I hear my own heart beating fast.#

{BLOCK:3}
It's a strange feeling indeed.@ The core of my body is heating up, and my skin is sweating.@ Static runs across my brain and my field of vision bounces and shakes.@>
Just like she said, it feels like denpa particles flowing to my insides.#

{BLOCK:4}
Am I nervous,@>
or perhaps am I excited?@>
Did I always like Tsukishima so much?#

{BLOCK:5}
Behind us, a whirlwind messes up with our hair.@>
Her hair dancing in the wind touches my cheeks.@>
Her thin, soft hair...@>
After the wind passes, strangely, my heart becomes as quiet as if nothing happened.#

{BLOCK:6}
A brief silence takes place.@>
It feels as if time itself stopped.@ The same sensation I'm so used to experience.@>
I'm back to this colorless, mute world.#

{BLOCK:7}
"See?"@>
Slowly, Tsukishima lets go of my hands she was holding.@>
At that instant, the world reverts to its original state.@>
"Do you understand now?"@>
"No, I'm afraid I don't."#

{BLOCK:8}
"Don't worry, you'll awaken your powers sooner or later."@>
"Awaken?@ Do you mean the denpa particles?"@>
"The power of denpa waves, yes.@ You have great talent for it."@>
Tsukishima blurts out nonsense again.@>
"Huh?@ Talent?@ For what?"@>
{CHARA:r03}
"I'll tell you when the time comes."@>
She smiles naively.#

{BLOCK:9}
Tsukishima used to be as beautiful as unapproachable.@>
Way, way more beautiful than TV models or finely crafted french dolls.#

{BLOCK:10}
But now...@ I see her as really adorable.#
