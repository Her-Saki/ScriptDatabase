As my thoughts jumble together without forming any solid idea, the first period of afternoon classes ends.@>
It's now break time.@>
The crowd of students reflects in my eyes like an 8mm film projected on a screen.@>
Since that day, the world has never lost its sound or color again.@>
I guess the possibility of something amusing or even supernatural happening in this world keeps me tied to it.#

{BLOCK:1}
During the break, a girl comes to my seat to talk with me.@>
{BGMFOUT}
{BGMWAIT}
{CHARA:r20}
{BGMPLAY:06}
"Umm, you're Yuusuke Nagase, correct?"@>
After I turn around to her voice, I see her standing before me; a short-haired girl wearing glasses.@>
I'm pretty sure she's a sophomore like me because I've seen her a couple of times before, but I don't remember her name.@>
"Yes, why?"@>
"I came to bring you the key as Mr. Nagase told me to do."@>
"Oh, thanks."#

{BLOCK:2}
She hands me the key she holds in her hand.@>
It's a brand-new, never-used key that looks like it was forged by a locksmith.@>
My uncle said this is the master key for the school building.@ With it I should be able to open every door in the school, except for the front entrance since it requires the access code.@>
{CHARA:r24}
"Umm..."@>
She already gave me the key, but it seems she still has something else to tell me.#

{BLOCK:3}
"Uuh...@ The teacher told me..."@>
The girl speaks self-effacingly.@>
"Huh?@ What?"@>
{CHARA:r20}
"Nagase...@ Ah, you share last names with Mr. Nagase, so perhaps I should call you "Yuusuke" instead...?@ Anyway, Yuusuke, I heard you're investigating about Kanako's incident.@ Is that true?"@>
"How do you know?"@>
{CHARA:r22}
"Mr. Nagase told me about it."#

{BLOCK:4}
I drop my jaw unintentionally.@>
"HE told you?"@>
"Yes."@>
I'm so shocked I don't find the words to reply.@>
What is my uncle thinking?@ I don't get it...@ Didn't he send me to investigate because he suspected the teachers' investigation was leaked to the culprits?@>
It's entirely possible that this girl is also one of them.@>
That said, I think that likelihood is extremely low.#

{BLOCK:5}
"What did he tell you, specifically?"@>
I need to verify how much she knows.@>
{CHARA:r20}
"He only gave me a brief summary.@ Mr. Nagase said the cause of Kana--...@ Ohta's breakdown could be some weird reunions she participated in.@ He also told me that you'll come to school tonight to investigate the matter."@>
It looks like he didn't inform her the details, only the gist of it.#

{BLOCK:6}
"Yeah, that's right."@>
I take a look around and talk in a low voice, making sure no one among the students is overhearing us.@>
"We don't know where the culprits could be hiding, so I'd like to keep the investigation as low-profile as possible."@>
"I understand.@ Otherwise it'd be pointless to send a student like you to patrol."@>
Well, I'm glad she got that part right...\c
{CHARA:r21}
\e

{BLOCK:7}
"Um, I have a little request if you don't mind."@>
Suddenly, she gazes at me with a serious look.@>
While she's well-mannered, I feel her eyes give off a sort of intense aura.@>
"A request?"@>
She takes her right hand up to her chest, and...@>
{CHARA:r26}
"Please let me help you with the investigation."@>
she says.#

{BLOCK:8}
"Did my uncle order you to help?"@>
{CHARA:r24}
"No, he refused arguing it'll be late at night and dangerous."@>
"He's right.@ The inspection will take place quite late, and it may even last until midnight.@ It's no big deal for me since my house is near, but..."@>
"That's not a problem for me, either, since I live nearby too."#

{BLOCK:9}
"Besides, your family would be worried.@ You're a girl, so I bet your father would make a fuss about it."@>
"I only live with my mother, but...@ I'll be fine.@ She's a very understanding person."#

{BLOCK:10}
"But it's still dangerous, and we don't know what could happen there."@>
{CHARA:r22}
"I think having a partner by your side will make you feel reassured.@ Also, despite I may not look like it, I'm very athletic."#

{BLOCK:11}
I can tell she's serious about this, but why does she want to help in the investigation so much?@>
We won't be doing any mystery tour, and it'd be a problem if she wants to join just for fun.@>
"I'm glad you want to cooperate, but, why do you want to do it so badly?@ Do you have a reason in particular?"@>
{CHARA:r24}
"W-Well..."@>
She hesitates.@ It looks like it's something difficult to say for her.#

{BLOCK:12}
"For starters, I don't believe the investigation will make good progress just because you're there."@>
{CHARA:r21}
"No, I think I could be helpful.@ I'm a member of the student council, so I know about the club activities and the buildings' arrangement better than the average student, and..."@>
"Do you belong to the student council?"@>
"Y-Yes, I do.@ I'm the secretary.@ Oh, silly me, I never told you my name, didn't I?"@>
"No, you didn't."@>
{CHARA:r22}
"S-Sorry.@ I'm Mizuho Aihara."#

{BLOCK:13}
Mizuho Aihara, the secretary.#

{BLOCK:14}
The fact that she belongs to the S.C. means she must be very close to Ohta.@>
After all, Ohta was the S.C's vice president.#

{BLOCK:15}
"If you two participated in the student council, were you acquaintances?"@>
{CHARA:r24}
"No, not just...@ acquaintances."@
She says dropping her head in sadness.@>
"Kanako was my best friend since middle school."@>
"Oh, I... see."#

{BLOCK:16}
"I entered this high school and enrolled myself in the student council just to be close to her.@ We were always together, even the day prior to the incident..."@>
"You mean Sunday?"@>
"Yes, we hung out that day.@ We went shopping, then to the movies, ate hamburgers..."@>
"How was she that day?@ Did she act differently than usual?"@>
"No.@ She was the same Kanako I knew and loved."#

{BLOCK:17}
"So she behaved normally."@>
"Yes, but the next day..."@>
Mizuho becomes disheartened.@>
"I met her in the hallway and greeted her as usual, and..."@>
"And?"@>
"And then she looked back at me, but...@ But she passed me by and ignored me...@ I thought I had offended her somehow so I called out to her again, but..."@>
Her eyes dampen.#

{BLOCK:18}
"W-When I tried to stop her, Kanako brushed me away...@ She said "fuck off", and then..."@>
{CHARA:r23}
Mizuho wipes her tears with the back of her clenched hands.@>
After that, Ohta probably said something unspeakable to Mizuho.@>
"Kanako...@ Kanako..."#

{BLOCK:19}
"I understand now.@ That's why you want to help with the investigation so desperately, right?"@>
Still wiping her tears, Mizuho nods.@ She's weeping quietly as her shoulders tremble.@>
Regardless of the reason, I made a girl cry before me, so I can't help but worry about the glares of everyone around.@>
"Okay, I got it.@ I'll call you later, so could you wait until then?"\c
{CHARA:r24}
\e

{BLOCK:20}
"Yes, I will."@>
"What is your class?"@>
"It's A."@>
That's the class next to mine.@ That explains why I recalled seeing her before.@>
"Whenever I'm not in the classroom, I stay at the student council."@>
"Got it.@ "A" classroom or the student council, correct?"@>
"Yes."@>
Mizuho nods with teary eyes.#

{BLOCK:21}
"Alright, see you later."@>
I tell her as to wrap up our meeting.@ She then makes a little farewell gesture as she rubs her eyes and takes her leave.@>
{CHARA:r99}
By the time she turns around, she already wiped her tears and her mouth was shut tight.@>
She appears to be a glass-hearted crybaby, but perhaps she possess a strong soul on the inside.#

{BLOCK:22}
Mizuho Aihara, the student council's secretary...@>
Now that I think about it calmly, letting Mizuho join the survey could be advantageous just as she said.@>
Maybe her help would make the inspection go smoothly.@>
It could be worth it to consider her seriously for the task.#
