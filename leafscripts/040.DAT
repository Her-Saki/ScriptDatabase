As I thought, Mizuho was in the student council room.@>
"Ah!"@>
{BGMFOUT}
{BGMWAIT}

When I call out to her, a big smile appears on her face and she comes running over to me like a puppy.@>
"Glad you're here, Yuusuke."@>
"I promised I'd come, didn't I?"@>
"Yes, thank you."@>
She nods.@>
Every gesture she does gives me the impression of an obedient, docile girl.#

{BLOCK:1}
"Thank you very much for coming all the way here."@>
She says apologetically.@>
"It was no big deal, really..."@>
I take a wide look at the room.@>
There are some members of the student council conversing.@ Crazy to think that, until just last week, Ohta was working with them as the beloved vice president...@>

{BLOCK:2}
"Are you guys in a meeting?"@>
{CHARA:r20}
"Oh, no, we aren't, but..."@>
Mizuho looks at me with upturned eyes, smiling somewhat painfully.@>
"Okay then, we'll collect 1500 yen each one for the flowers, right, Mizuho?"@>
One of the female students asks to Mizuho.@>
"Y-Yes, thank you."@>
She answers.#

{BLOCK:3}
"Are you going to visit Ohta?"@>
"Yes.@ I thought about sending her flowers."@>
Mizuho was friends with Ohta since childhood, so she probably wants to present her flowers in behalf of the student council since she's currently hospitalized.#

{BLOCK:4}
"By the way, I want to talk with you about something.@ Got a minute?"@>
I tell her, pointing my gaze towards the other students in the room.@>
I'd be awkward to discuss THAT topic here.@>
Fortunately, Mizuho grasps my intention without delay.@>
"Yes.@ Please excuse me, but I have a little business with Yuu--...@ Nagase."@>
With those goodbye words, she leaves the staff room and closes the door.\c

{BLOCK:5}
"Let's talk right there in the courtyard."@>
"Yes."@>
I take Mizuho with me and we leave for the courtyard.#
