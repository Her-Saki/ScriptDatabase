"You've already heard that Ohta has been coming to school late by night since three weeks prior to the incident, right?"@>
"Yes."@>
"You don't know anything about that?@ Y'know, something you heard from her by chance..."@>
{CHARA:r24}
Mizuho shakes her head apologetically.#

{BLOCK:1}
"No, she never told me anything about that, but..."@>
"But?"@>
"Kanako's mom called me once asking me if she dropped by my house."@>
"And that happened...?"@>
"About three weeks ago."#

{BLOCK:2}
Naturally, at some point Ohta's mom wondered where the hell her daughter went every night.@>
"However, when we had that call, Kanako's mom never mentioned she parted home each night.@ She only asked me if Kanako came, and I answered with the truth: that she didn't.@ That's it."@>
"I see...@ I thought you'd know since you're so close to Ohta."@>
"I'm sorry."@>
"No need to apologize.@ It's not your fault."\c

{BLOCK:3}
"No, I'm partially to blame for this."@>
"Partially?"@>
"Yes.@ Despite I'm her friend, I didn't know anything about the problems she was facing.@ I wasn't able to help her until she became like that."@>
"You're just overthinking.@ No matter how intimate you were, you're still different persons.@ There are some boundaries you just never cross."#

{BLOCK:4}
Normally, I'm not the kind of guy who says things like these.@>
However, right now I want to console Mizuho so badly I'm using words I'm not used to say.@>
"It's pointless to blame yourself."@>
{CHARA:r20}
"Yuusuke..."@>
Mizuho wipes her tears and looks at me.@>
"T-Thank you."#

{BLOCK:5}
I feel my heart beating slightly faster than normal.#
