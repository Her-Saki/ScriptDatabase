Inside a pitch-black darkness, I hear someone crying.@>
*Sob*@ *Sob*@>
Their weeping reaches my ears.#

{BLOCK:1}
{PCMLOAD:17}
Is it a kid?@>
No, it isn't.@>
It's a young girl.#

{BLOCK:2}
*Plop*@>
A drop?@ Yeah, that was a drop.@>
A teardrop falling to the ground.@>
The drops fall slowly to the water's surface, forming gentle ripples of light.#

{BLOCK:3}
Illuminated by the light of the ripples, the figure of a girl cowering comes into my view.@>
{PCMWAIT}
{PCMFOUT}
{BGMPLAY:10}
{VISUAL:259912}
That girl is...@ Ruriko.#

{BLOCK:4}
Ruriko...@>
Why are you crying?@>
What are you so sad about?@>
However, my voice doesn't reach her.#

{BLOCK:5}
Another bright ripple spreads out.@>
Its light lits up the darkness, and Ruriko's figure appears once again.@>
She wears a sailor uniform with ragged sleeves.@ Her hair is messy, and her face is covered in tears.@>
Dripping tears...@>
that flow down her face as she gets defiled.#

{BLOCK:6}
"I'm sorry, Ruriko."@>
I hear that voice coming from beyond the darkness.@>
It's the gentle voice of a man.@>
"I'm sorry, Ruriko."@>
He repeats.@>
However, Ruriko keeps crying crouching on the floor.#

{BLOCK:7}
"I love you so much, Ruriko, so why...?@ Why...?"@>
Streaming across her cheeks before dropping to the floor, Ruriko's tears form flashing ripples on the puddle below her.@>
"Is it really wrong?@ Is it taboo to fall in love with someone and pursue that love to the very end?"@>
His voice is pure, innocent, unpolluted.@>
A voice that envelops Ruriko tenderly.#

{BLOCK:8}
However, her teardrops keep projecting endless light ripples.@>
"I love you, Ruriko.@ I love you, Ruriko."@>
Her shoulders tremble as she weeps.@>
"I love you, Ruriko.@ I love you, Ruriko.@ I love you, Ruriko.@ I love you, Ruriko..."@>
His voice repeats those words again and again, as if chanting a spell.#

{BLOCK:9}
"I LOVE YOU, RURIKO. I LOVE YOU, RURIKO. I LOVE YOU, RURIKO I LOVE YOU RURIKOILOVEYOURURIKOILOVEYOURURI..."#

{BLOCK:10}
Just like a broken machine, he keeps repeating the same words in aeternum...\c
