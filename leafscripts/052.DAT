One of my cheeks feels cold, but the other one feels warm.#

{BLOCK:1}
I just noticed I fell asleep.@>
However, my drowsiness recedes little by little, and at the same pace, I open my eyelids.#

{BLOCK:2}
A human-like figure appears in my hazy field of vision.@>
I wonder who it is...@>
I'm lying down on the floor and resting my head on their lap.@>
Eventually, my blurred vision comes into focus and I realize the person is actually Ruriko.@>
The warmth I feel in one of my cheeks comes from her lap, and the coldness I feel in the other comes from her hand.@>
She peeks at my face fixedly.\c

{BLOCK:3}
"Ruriko?"@>
"Hello."@>
She says in a low voice.@>
As if pulled by a thread, I slowly sit upright.@>
My head feels heavy, just like if I lifted it forcibly after oversleeping.@>
"Where am I?"#

{BLOCK:4}
The sky has gotten completely dark.@>
A full, round moon is up, and beyond the fence I can see the lights of the city.@>
"It's night..."@>
A pretty obvious thing to say.@ I shake slightly my head, but then, I feel a sharp twinge of pain in it.#

{BLOCK:5}
Judging by the situation around, it looks like I lost consciousness for a good while.@>
Did Ruriko stay by my side all this time?@>
I wonder if I had that dream because she was here with me...@>
That dream...#

{BLOCK:6}
Ruriko cowering and quivering...@>
Her teardrops flowing down her cheeks...@>
The light ripples spreading across that puddle...#

{BLOCK:7}
"Ruriko...@ You were crying..."@>
My mouth speaks by itself.@>
"You were crying...@ all while looking terribly sad."#

{BLOCK:8}
That was a dream.@ I have no doubt that it was just that.@>
But...@>
"Who made you cry?@ Why were you so sad?"@>
I ask her as I stare at her face.#

{BLOCK:9}
It's no use to ask her that, since she has no way to answer.@>
In fact, she's now looking at me with a troubled expression.@>
Nonetheless, I just can't accept that it was only a dream.@>
"Who made you like this, Ruriko?@ Why did you become like this?"@>
I touch softly her cheek and stroke her smooth skin with the back of my hand.#

{BLOCK:10}
"Someone hurt you, am I wrong?"@>
My field of vision becomes blurry.@>
Huh?@ What's going on?@>
"What's wrong, Naga?@ Do you feel sad?"@>
Ruriko looks at me on the verge of tears.#

{BLOCK:11}
"Don't cry, Naga."@>
Me?@ Crying?@ Why?@ You were crying, not me, Ruriko...@>
Ruriko pats gently my head.@>
This is weird.@ This is not normal.@ I mean, our roles have now reversed...#

{BLOCK:12}
Tears dropped from my eyes.@>
Teardrop after teardrop...@>
dripping endlessly.\c
