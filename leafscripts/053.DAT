One of my cheeks feels cold, but the other one feels warm.#

{BLOCK:1}
I don't know when it happened, but it seems I lost consciousness.@>
However, I come to my senses little by little, and at the same pace, I open my eyelids.#

{BLOCK:2}
A human-like figure appears in my hazy field of vision.@>
I wonder who it is...@>
I'm lying down on the floor and resting my head on their lap.@>
Eventually, my blurred vision comes into focus and I realize the person is actually Ruriko.@>
The warmth I feel in one of my cheeks comes from her lap, and the coldness I feel in the other comes from her hand.@>
She peeks at my face fixedly.\c

{BLOCK:3}
"Ruriko?"@>
"......"@>
She's dead silent.@>
As if pulled by a thread, I slowly sit upright.@>
My head feels heavy, just as if I lifted it forcibly after oversleeping.@>
"Where am I?"#

{BLOCK:4}
The sky has gotten completely dark.@>
A full, round moon is up, and beyond the fence I can see the lights of the city.@>
"It's night..."@>
A pretty obvious thing to say.@ I shake slightly my head, but then, I feel a sharp twinge of pain in it.#

{BLOCK:5}
Judging by the situation around, it looks like I got knocked out for a good while.@>
Did Ruriko stay by my side all this time?@>
I wonder if I had that dream because she was here with me...#

{BLOCK:6}
Ruriko stares straight into my eyes with a somewhat cold expression on her face, but eventually, she opens her mouth slowly.@>
"You lied to me, Naga."@>
Her voice is cold, devoid of all emotion.#

{BLOCK:7}
{CHABG:c01331010}
"You lied when you said you could use electromagnetic waves.@ You haven't mastered their power yet."@>
For some reason, Ruriko's eyes look sorrowful.@>
That makes my chest hurt with guilt.@>
"I-I'm sorry.@ I...@ I just..."@>
Awkwardly, I try to keep appereances.@>
However, I don't find anything appropriate to say.@>
"I-I...@ I just...@ wanted...@ to see the same delusion as you."#

{BLOCK:8}
"Delusion?"@>
Ruriko whispers as she slowly stands up.@>
Then, gazing at me with those despondent eyes, she tells me:@>
"You're just like everyone else, Naga.@ You make fun of electromagnetic waves.@ How dare you call them a "delusion"?"@>
"T-That wasn't what I..."@>
"Goodbye."@>
Beautiful gem-like teardrops spill from her eyes.@>

{BLOCK:9}
She turns around and slowly walks away.@>
{CHARA:c99}
"R-Ruriko!"@>
I chase her back desperately, but strangely, my body doesn't move an inch.@>
It feels like it isn't my own body.@>
"Ruriko!"#

{BLOCK:10}
My body stands glued against the fence for a while even after she takes her leave.\c
