Based on Shinjo's testimony, we patrol near the 2nd gym.@>
The 2nd gym is the newest one and is used by the volleyball club, which is known for being one of the strongest teams in the prefecture.@ They always stay up late training.@>
That said, there's not a soul to be found at this time of night.#

{BLOCK:1}
The light from the full, round moon is so bright it projects every shadow sharply on the floor, and thanks to that, we can see very far away without any light source.@>
Cherry trees line up around the gym.@>
For now, we just walk along it.@>
We make sure we don't miss any shadow or lit spot, but in the end, we don't find anything.#

Next we try to enter the gym.@>
The door is locked.@>
I insert the master key my uncle gave me, but it doesn't work.@>
Apparently, this key is only useful inside the school's main building, and not in the gym or other facilities.@>
Our search range narrowed a lot, but there's hardly anything we can do about it.@>
If the investigation continues until tomorrow, I'll ask for the gym key to my uncle.#
