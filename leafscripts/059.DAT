{BLOCKLEN:12}

{BLOCK:0}
We kick-start the investigation.@>
First of all, the school premises.\c
{BG:290303}
\e

{BLOCK:1}
We move to the front gate.@>
Obviously, the door is locked, so I input the code my uncle told me.@>
0...@ *Beep*...@ 8...@ *Beep*...@ 2...@ *Beep*...@ 4...@ *Beep*...@>
*Vrooom!*@ The electronic lock is released along with the roar of a motor.@>
I insert the master key in the hole and turn it, and after removing it, I slowly open it.\c
{BG:440303}
\e

{BLOCK:2}
The school building is eerily silent and packed with cold air.@>
As I expected, there's no trace of human presence here.@>
I don't think there's anybody here.\c
{BG2:440303}
\e

{BLOCK:3}
We start walking around.@>
Warm moonlight lights up the pitch-black darkness.@>
I can't make out anything, no matter how closely I look or hear.\c
{BG:050303}
\e

{BLOCK:4}
We enter every room there is, but we don't find anything worth mentioning.\c
{BG:460303}
\e

{BLOCK:5}
The staff room.@>
No way they're holding those strange meetings here...\c
{BG:480303}
\e

{BLOCK:6}
2nd floor, 3rd floor...@>
Nothing in sight.\c
{BG:150303}
\e

{BLOCK:7}
We don't find anything in the school building, so we look elsewhere.\c
{BG:110303}
\e

{BLOCK:8}
We exit the main building and patrol near the gym.@>
Here's where Shinjo saw those suspicious shadows.#

{BLOCK:9}
The 2nd gym is the newest one and is used by the volleyball club, which is known for being one of the strongest teams in the prefecture.@ They always stay up late training.@>
That said, there's not a soul to be found at this time of night.#

{BLOCK:10}
The light from the full, round moon is so bright it projects every shadow sharply on the floor, and thanks to that,, we can see very far away without any light source.@>
Cherry trees line up around the gym.@>
For now, we just walk along it.@>
We make sure we don't miss any shadow or lit spot, but in the end, we don't find anything.#

{BLOCK:11}
Next we try to enter the gym.@>
The door is locked.@>
I insert the master key my uncle gave me, but it doesn't work.@>
Apparently, this key is only useful inside the school's main building, and not in the gym or other facilities.@>
Our search range narrowed a lot, but there's hardly anything we can do about it.@>
If the investigation continues until tomorrow, I'll ask for the gym key to my uncle.#
