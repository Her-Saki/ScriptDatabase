Hi, Saorin here!@
This game features several endings, but one among them is the TRUE ending that touches the core of the story.@
Once you reach it, the real plot behind Shizuku will be revealed...@ or so they say.@
However, obtaining that ending can be quite challenging, so here's some tips!#

{BLOCK:1}
First off, Ruriko is the girl who holds the key of the story.@
The main condition to get the true ending is to meet her.@
She likes to talk about wacky stuff like electromagnetic waves and whatnot, but be careful not to take what she says lightly!@
You must NEVER tell her she's lying or talking nonsense!#

{BLOCK:2}
The other key is me, Saori.@ Listen carefully to what I say and choose wisely your investigation spot!@
That way, you'll be able to open the door of a certain place!#

{BLOCK:3}
Should you fail, though, you'll meet a CREEEEEPY ending, so these two takeaways are of particular importance!#

{BLOCK:4}
Also, the true ending has seemingly only a tragic version, but actually, there's also a happy version of it.@
After getting the first version, you might as well try to unlock the other one.#

{BLOCK:5}
But wait, there's more!@
After you saw these two true endings, you can access a bizarre hidden scene!@
Everybody out there, please give it your best to complete the game!@
Let's meet again in the true ending!#

Yo, Saori here!@
From the next round onwards, you can hold down the shift key to skip scenes you've already read!@
After you see an ending, the data in the save slot will be reset back to the beginning of the story, but after meeting certain conditions you'll have new choices available in your next play, so you should keep playing in the same save slot!@
However, if you choose "delete saved data" in the main menu, your save will be gone, so watch out!@
Let's meet again in the second ending!@ I'll give you more useful hints!#

Hiya, I'm Saori!@
This game, Shizuku, features a whopping 13 endings!@ However, there's a lot of small details to discover along the way!@
Perhaps obtaining all the CGs will prove more difficult than you think...@
Also, in a certain scene someone will tell you a secret command, so give it a try!@
Anyway, good luck!@
